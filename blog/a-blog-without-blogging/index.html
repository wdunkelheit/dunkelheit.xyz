<h2>A Blog Without Blogging</h2>

<p>When I first started this blog it was purely as an exercise in staking my e-claim on my e-land as the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=3dIVesHEAzc">meme at the time</a> suggested. It was a fun exercise that let me refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS and it led me to learn Hugo too and since then I&rsquo;ve been posting to this site whenever I feel like something I&rsquo;ve written is worth posting.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t do much blogging, in fact I&rsquo;ve done basically none at all!</p>
<p>I intend to change that. The idea of writing a blog is appealing I&rsquo;ve just never felt like I had anything interesting going on. I blame doing a CompSci degree for this though. Now that I am doing a degree that I actually want to do I have probably too much that I want to write down about it.</p>
<p>When last semester ended I planned to blog about my experience, what I thought of the various classes, the campus, the environment of the university in general but I never got around to it. So I will cover both semesters at the same time when this one is finished.</p>
<p>In fact there is a bunch of stuff I would like to start writing about that I haven&rsquo;t had the time to. Such as book reviews, travel logs and personal updates. The idea of &ldquo;building your own platform&rdquo; was supposed to give the opportunity to do these things and I never took advantage of it when I wanted to. I will be doing so more often starting now.</p>
