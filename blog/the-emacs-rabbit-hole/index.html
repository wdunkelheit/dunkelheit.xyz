<p>I have been using Emacs as my text editor for about a year now. I still have no idea what I am doing but at least I know why.</p>
<h3 id="cosy-and-powerful">Cosy and Powerful</h3>
<p>The Emacs client is very lightweight and it can be self-extended whilst running by using Elisp. I am not quite sure how it works as Elisp is too far down the rabbit hole and I haven&rsquo;t been there yet.</p>
<p>Emacs is very modular to the point that you can use it as an entire operating system if you so choose. It can be used as a windowing manager, a web browser, an email client. Not bad for a text editor right?</p>
<p>Some believe that this makes Emacs monolithic but that is due to a misconception that Emacs itself is doing all of these things and not the independent Elisp and C programs running within it.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago I learned that you can run Emacs as a server, I don&rsquo;t even know what purpose this would have but it sounds cool.</p>
<h3 id="vim-gang">Vim gang</h3>
<p>Prior to using Emacs I used Vim as my editor of choice. I still do for single file editing. I love the Vim keybindings, macros, instruction language, etc. So when I heard that you can use these in Emacs with Evil mode I decided to give it a go.</p>
<h3 id="one-year-later">One Year Later</h3>
<p>The thing I have found to be the most impressive about Emacs after a year of use is how it just &ldquo;works&rdquo; in a minimalist way. There&rsquo;s no bells and whistles, I don&rsquo;t need to use my mouse for anything. Once it has been launched it is ready to go, my way.</p>
<p>I use Evil mode in Emacs and it is indistinguishable from using Vim in a terminal except I am no longer held back by any limitations built into a given terminal emulator. At first I missed being unable to use Alt key for quick normal mode instructions but I have since rebound my keyboard to be more Emacs compatible and find the Emacs way of doing things more intuitive.</p>
<p>I have yet to try Emacs tools such as <code>magit</code> and <code>rmail</code> but this is mostly due to wanting to wait until I learn Emacs properly. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="taking-off-the-training-wheels">Taking off the training wheels</h3>
<p>I want to learn Emacs from scratch, as it stands for the last year I have not been using Emacs &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; in the sense that I haven&rsquo;t been using it in a way that allows me to learn how it works.</p>
<p>I have been using an Emacs &ldquo;rice&rdquo; named <code>Doom Emacs</code>. Which is effectively a glorified interface for package management that handles all of the initial setup of the packages that come with it.</p>
<p>My plan is to learn the intricacies of Emacs configuration, how to correctly use Org mode for documentation and organisation and create an Emacs build that only has what I need and want in it. My hope is that by doing so I will learn more of the intricacies of Emacs and will be able to use it more effectively and maybe start writing my own Elisp extensions.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-know">In The Know</h3>
<p>I think that my experience of learning Emacs from scratch will be interesting enough to some people that I may blog about it a bit. I am not sure whether I will do so by updating this post or by making new posts regarding a specific topic, etc I want to talk about. Stay tuned!</p>
