        <meta property="og:description" content="Overnight oats is a nice easy alternative to porridge that you eat cold instead. A very simple dish to make and can be supplemented with various additions to increase taste, macros and texture.
This is my personal way of making it, you will find hundreds of ways of doing it online though, experiment until you find what you like.

⏲️ Prep time: 5 min
🍽️ Servings: 1

Ingredients

Rolled Oats
Whole Milk
Whey Protein Powder
Greek Yoghurt (Optional)
Fruit of choice (Optional)

Directions

Measure out your preferred serving of oats. Add to a glass or cup.

I like to go for a good couple of handfuls.


Add one serving of whey protein powder to the oats.
At this stage you can add other things you like to it. I sometimes add cinnamon or nutmeg.
Pour milk until oats and whey are covered.
Mix together until whey powder is evenly distributed.
Add more milk as needed, you want to cover the dry ingredients entirely.
Cover the glass or cup with cling film and place in the fridge.
In the morning you will now have overnight oats.

Depending on how much milk you used you will now find either:

A peanut butter like consistency
A milkshake like consistency
Something in between.


Experimenting is key until you find the right consistency for you.


You may now add Yoghurt to the top. (Optional)
You may now add your fruit of choice to the yoghurt. (Optional)

Notes:

You can use many different kinds of ingredients when making this. I plan to update this recipe when I find interesting additions and alternatives.
I use a 100% whey protein powder, absent of soy, pea and other &ldquo;proteins&rdquo;.
You can add whatever you like to this, the key with this is experimenting and finding what you like.

I like to switch whey flavours around, sometimes I add some chocolate, etc.
