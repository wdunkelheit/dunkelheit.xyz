      <title>Bitcoin and Monero Extremism</title>

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;postmeme&#34; style=&#34;max-height: 240px;&#34; src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/bitcoin-monero-extremism/monero-pilled.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34; title=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Bitcoin maximalist but I am also a Monero extremist. These positions aren&amp;rsquo;t mutually exclusive. In fact these two technologies combined solve the problems of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-cash-digital-gold&#34;&gt;Digital Cash, Digital Gold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems almost inevitable at this point that Bitcoin will overtake Gold as the strongest (in terms of market cap) store of wealth. Bitcoin is the new gold standard üòâ for storing wealth but it&amp;rsquo;s not very good at being money any more (just like gold). Due to high transaction fees and currency speculation it is better to not use your Bitcoin and to just HODL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are emergent technologies trying to solve this problem like the lightning network there are some issues regarding anonymity and privacy that makes traditional cash superior for transacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Monero comes in. Being the only cryptocurrency that allows for transactions to be both anonymous and private, Monero functions almost exactly like physical cash does, except digitally and without out of control money printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero can be swapped for Bitcoin using decentralised platforms too meaning you do not require the traditional finance system to acquire it. There is also the experimental technology of atomic swaps that allows private chain-to-chain transactions to swap one crypto for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons Bitcoin and Monero are the only cryptocurrencies that have legitimate use cases as currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility-tokens&#34;&gt;Utility Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other cryptocurrencies that aren&amp;rsquo;t shitcoins but these are mostly utility tokens such as the Brave foundation&amp;rsquo;s BAT (Basic Attention Token) and Namecoin. But as utility tokens these function as a means to an end and not as a form of savings or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proof-of-stake---proof-of-shitcoin&#34;&gt;Proof of stake - Proof of shitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof of stake is anti-crypto. It allows for the largest bag holders to control the network and takes the decentralisation of proof of work away. Making transactions censorable and the currency defacto non-fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;muh-power-usage&#34;&gt;Muh power usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most energy alarmism this is a non-issue. If you understand how electric power is generated and how much of it goes to waste due to fluctuations in demand then you will see that Bitcoin actually incentivises energy innovation and prevents waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this is demonstrated in real life Bitcoin mining practices. Countries with cheap electricity get more Bitcoin mining operations in them which brings more money into the local economy as well as incentivising said means of creating energy. El Salvador plans to mine Bitcoin using geothermal for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to explain how Bitcoin mining reduces waste is that miners seeking the highest return on their investment will go where the energy is cheapest and most abundant, leaving the places were it is more costly and limited. This effectively allows for excess energy production in one part of the world to be utilised elsewhere by proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-friends-into-crypto&#34;&gt;Getting friends into crypto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting friends and family into crypto can be difficult. A cool trick I found is to get them to install a wallet app, send them a small amount (about $5 worth) and show them how easy it is to use by sending it back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to show and not tell, especially when trying to explain bleeding edge technologies. However you will want to make sure that person you are introducing cryptocurrencies to understands the importance of self custody, securing their devices, backing up their seed phrases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will be technically competent enough to do all of this which is fine. If this is the case then you will need to adjust as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is easiest to get people into as it has brand recognition and is the easiest to acquire. It also has a reputation of being &amp;ldquo;internet stocks&amp;rdquo; which attracts the wrong kind of attitude sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero is harder to recommend to people as most people that get into crypto just want gains and don&amp;rsquo;t see the point in using it as money when they can use money. I understand this position and why it is held, which is why I generally only recommend Monero to people that are already internet present. That is not to say however that I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to people anyway, just that if they have no real use for it then they will be better off just buying some Bitcoin sats instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact one thing that Monero is excellent for is teaching someone the basics of how cryptocurrencies work with real life examples but without breaking the bank. It is also good at giving people an idea of how other cryptocurrencies aren&amp;rsquo;t private or anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating QR Codes for Crypto</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a blog or a website or have any kind of online presence then you should be accepting crypto donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain why you should accept crypto here because &lt;a href=&#34;https://landchad.net/crypto&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; exists. Please read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crypto-addresses&#34;&gt;Crypto Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to use third party platforms to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need is your address and you are good to go. In this example I will be assuming that you have custody of your crypto wallet(s) and don&amp;rsquo;t use fiat-crypto‚Ñ¢Ô∏è platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example I will be using a Monero address but the same method will work for all cryptocurrencies that use a single-string address. Which &lt;a href=&#34;#tips&#34;&gt;all two&lt;/a&gt; of the important ones do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all you are going to want to know your Crypto receive address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this for Monero: &lt;code&gt;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly you are going to want to install the &lt;code&gt;python-qrcode&lt;/code&gt; package. It is available under this name on Arch and Debian based distros. It can also be &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/&#34;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have these two tools you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generating-the-qr-code&#34;&gt;Generating the QR code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the following into your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with your actual address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will now have a png image file in your current directory. You can now use this on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of it in use see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/donate&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-use-this-program&#34;&gt;Why Use This Program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be considering using an online QR code generator. But any code running on someone else&amp;rsquo;s hardware cannot be trusted with something as sensitive as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an advanced user you can use this tool with optimisation options or you can output your QR code to an SVG instead. You can use this in combination with other QR code optimisation tools to minimize the file size if that is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two cryptocurrencies actually matter these are Bitcoin and Monero. All other cryptos are gambling or memes (or a dangerous combination of both). &lt;strong&gt;Not financial advice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always give the user the option to donate with the address itself too. In fact its a good idea to provide the address with the QR code so that they can verify the QR resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be a good idea to create a minimalist solution to allow the user to expand the page with the given QR codes if you plan to include them on other pages on your site. This is only relevant if your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t accommodate for this in its design anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
