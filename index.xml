      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a moment of minimalist induced madness I decided to try out the Apple ecosystem, this was a few years ago now and I have been using it long enough to have formed my opinions on it based on experience and observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the Apple ecosystem is normie coded. This is not intended as an insult or a smug remark however, in fact it&amp;rsquo;s just a conclusion and one that I think Apple themselves are aiming for. These devices have nailed their intended function: be a device that does everything the user expects, do it in the simplest way possible to avoid user frustration and sell the user on the concept of &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s get some things clear and dismiss a few myths: Apple devices are powerful hardware (this is obiviously the case),  they aare and aren&amp;rsquo;t walled gardens (this is complicated) and they are not designed exclusively for non-technical customers which is probably the most common and reddit coded take someone could have on Apple devices. Keep these observations in mind as I explore my experience with these devices and explain my thoughts regarding whether or not the Apple ecosystem is worthwhile for myself or for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I begin I will mention that this is written with my experience with the iPhone 15, Macbook Air M1 and AirPods Pro 2nd generation as my Apple experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the simplest part of the Apple package, the hardware. These devices are powerful, they have fantastic battery lives and they are extremely lightweight and clean in their construction. Can you get more powerful devices for the money? absolutely, better battery life? I assume so, just as lightweight? of course. But can you get a device that is just as clean? yeah that&amp;rsquo;s possible too. But from all my research I could not find devices that met all these requirements at once at the same price point. Now of course hardware is not the be all and end all of whether a device is good and in my expierence it&amp;rsquo;s the software that matters most to me. Which is where pretty much every single complaint I have about the Apple ecosystem finds itself levelled. Or put simply: if I could have Linux on my Macbook I would, if I could have Android on an iPhone would I? no, I&amp;rsquo;d rather have an Android phone than an &amp;ldquo;iDroid&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these devices I can honestly say that I was impressed by what I used but mostly by the battery life and the lightweight construction of the Macbook Air M1. I used this thing as my daily driver for a year, travelling to and from classes, the library and home and only needing to charge it at night before bed. I pretty much never turned the thing off except for updates and it would just open up to everything I had before instantly, everytime. I loved this, I still love this, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much my favourite part of this machine. This was the killer feature of this device for me and it still is. The battery life on this thing is phenomenal and since I only used it for the purpose of writing, note taking, programming and web browsing it did everything I needed and more, incredibly quickly and without any major effect on the battery life of the device. A stressfree experience with battery life and performance is what I want in a laptop and I can say that I got what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the hardware of the iPhone 15 I was also impressed, this phone is fast, has decent battery life (regardless of poor battery optimisation of App Store applications) and the camera takes the greatest video I have ever seen on a mobile device as well as excellent photographs. So in terms of the abstract hardware features I found the device to be pleasant to use and had no real issues related to it&amp;rsquo;s hardware performance. Pretty much every issue I had with this device was with it&amp;rsquo;s software and the ecosystem it is built around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless earbuds are not really my thing, I prefer headphones and I&amp;rsquo;d prefer them to be wired if possible but every phone manufacturer has taken it upon themselves to make it their personal crusade to make sure that no device has an audio jack. So I got a pair of AirPods Pro 2 for the gym as inears are much more comfortable in this environment. I love these things for the gym and for walking, the noise cancellation in particular is incredibly useful is a busy gym that blasts the worst music they could possible choose for that environment and the battery life on these things is seemingly endless. But a lot of these features stop working the second you use them on a non-Apple device which is a major red flag for me and one of the reasons I plan to leave the Apple plantation. (Spoilers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could rate Apple products on their hardware experience alone I&amp;rsquo;d say that it is fundamentally solid and whilst you pay a premium for the polish you do get what you pay for if you use these devices daily for their intended purposes. But that&amp;rsquo;s where the positives of Apple products are expected and unfortunately they start to become burdensome as we move on to looking at their software suite, also known as the Apple Ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s software suite is known as the Apple Ecosystem by most technologically concious internet users although I am unsure if it is a term that Apple themselves use or not, not that it matters as it is part of the zeitgeist whether they like it or not. I was unsure where to begin when talking about this ecosystem but I have come to the conclusion that there are a lot of positives to speak about that give more context to the negatives, so for the sake of not repeating myself to explain points I will start with the positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the quality of Apple&amp;rsquo;s software engineering I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone could say with a straight face that it is aesthetically or functionally bad. Aesthetics are a personal preference but when there is a unified design standard for the user interface in a given software suite I am willing to put aside some animosity towards the things I don&amp;rsquo;t like because at least less of my time is being wasted. Fortunately however I don&amp;rsquo;t have many negative things to say regarding the user interface of Apple&amp;rsquo;s software suites. In fact I find it to be a bit too intuitive that I feel like I may be missing something in some cases. So the design isn&amp;rsquo;t bad in my experience, and as a long time Linux user I can see where a lot of desktop application design ideas got their inspiration from. Functionally speaking I found no real issue with Apple&amp;rsquo;s software other than their terminal and text editor being rather basic by my standards but considering you even get something with a decent featureset out of the box compared to what I recall from Windows I will let it slide. I am willing to let it slide even further as MacOS is a &amp;ldquo;Unix&amp;rdquo; system and is immediately familiar to me and the tools that I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The included office suite is not only functional and has seemingly zero bloat but I actually really enjoyed using it to the point of missing it when I revert to using LibreOffice on my Linux desktop. The mail client is also a shining example of a fantastic application that gets the job done, although it misses some features I would have liked. The desktop experience is serviceable, I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself using the desktop much as I open the device to my opened tasks and continue what I was doing anyway. Safari is a serviceable browser but I installed Brave and Firefox almost immediately anyway, unlike on the iPhone you can actually install software on the Mac from outside of the app store. Once I had Homebrew installed and setup I installed all of my go to software immediately, dropped my dotfiles where they needed to go and it was as if I was back on my Linux desktop, other than the Mac desktop it was pretty much the same experience. The issues of the walled garden are seemingly exclusive to the iPhone but this is not true. On a Mac the walled garden has a gate and you can come and go as you please for the most part. On iPhone this is absolutely not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an iPhone you have to use what comes with the device or what you can find on the app store and you have to like it. In my case this didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me too much, in fact it was weirdly a selling point for me at the time as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have a device on my person that would distract me and I don&amp;rsquo;t have much of a desire to use my phone for anything other than calls, email, messages, camera and music. All of these features  come with the device as they do pretty much all Android devices too, although there are issues with these on Android too that is outside the scope of what I plan to discuss here. My biggest issue with the Apple ecosystem is not the locked down nature of the device itself, although I oppose this on principle but rather the fact that to put my own music on the device requires a Windows or Mac computer. Which luckily I had a Mac but then the process of moving music to the device was a nightmare as well. This is where the tyrannical nature of the walled garden is most blatant, if you want to use your own music you will be inconvenienced. If you want to sync your files, upload your photographs, videos, etc to your computer instead of iCloud, you will be inconvenienced. There are more examples of this but I think I make the point most clear with these as they are the most basic and fundamental examples of things I should be able to do when and how I want yet there are so many loops to jump through to do so. This will be the reason I switch to Android with my next phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I tried to explain to someone that I was having these issues I know that I would be met with &amp;ldquo;just use iCloud then&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pay for Apple music then&amp;rdquo; which not only would be completely ignoring the actual issue but creates an entirely new one. Why do I have to pay for an alternative when the standard option isn&amp;rsquo;t available in the first place? This is where the &amp;ldquo;normie coded&amp;rdquo; nature of the Apple ecosystem becomes obvious. These &amp;ldquo;solutions&amp;rdquo; to the problem are not solutions at all but the expected manner that you would use the device in. Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Fitness, etc everything is a subscription service. I don&amp;rsquo;t pay for any subscription services for reasons that should be obvious but in case it isn&amp;rsquo;t: why should I pay someone else to use my own stuff? Sure I can put my own music on the phone, sure I can get my photos and videos off the phone, but I have to jump through artificial hoops to do so when this was never the case on Android or in the age before the &amp;ldquo;smart phone&amp;rdquo;. Subscription services are a form of digital slavery and the way that the iPhone practically forces it upon their users is quite simply unacceptable. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to give in and pay for them but I surely will not be buying a new phone either and they can forget me jumping through their hoops. I have a Walkman A35 that I love and was using when I first got the iPhone, I had no idea of half these issues until I had owned the thing for almost a year I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep using my Walkman even when I switch to another platform for my mobile device which I will be doing out of principle. I will be decoupling myself from the iPhone and the Apple ecosystem entirely over this ridiculous and offensive push towards digital slavery. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be like this so I choose for it not to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that devices with such great hardware and software quality have such a crippling and ridiculous model of user exploitation baked into the design of the software suite. The iPhone having less features but better implementation of them was one of it&amp;rsquo;s selling points to me originally but their approach to simplicity being built around the idea of outright blocking you from using alternatives is a counter to any benefit it has to not being a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important observation to be made is that since it is designed this way on purpose, Apple knows that they can exploit their users this way and get away with it and they do get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normie-coded&#34;&gt;Normie Coded&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s devices are great and their ecosystem is awful. Conceptually the idea of a &amp;ldquo;software ecosystem&amp;rdquo; is kinda gross. It is normie coded in that it is designed to turn a consumer into a dependant and that allows for a vampiric business model of selling expensive devices that &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; to people that don&amp;rsquo;t know any better (this is not their fault) and then exploiting them with service fees for features that they have no alternative to. There is a demographic of users that will enjoy this business model, that don&amp;rsquo;t mind being ripped off because they would rather have convenience and these users would still opt into these services if alternatives were possible in fact they would likely see these services as an even greater convenience in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denying paying customers basic features and selling worse alternatives back to them at a monthly fee is disrespectful and outright exploitation. It is targeted to demographics that don&amp;rsquo;t know any better and will enjoy their exploitation because it is convenient to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got to try this experiment and see for myself just how bad it can be. It makes me appreciate just how good I have it and how much better it can be when I eventually switch to something better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Texas Chilli</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/texas-chilli/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/texas-chilli/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Mark Rippetoe, chilli does not contain beans. This is true.
Here is an adapted version of his Texas Chilli recipe &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/iWgfdytTd8o&#34;&gt;(that you can find here)&lt;/a&gt; with some changes and adaptations for what is available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef Tallow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pork Sausages (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Onions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jalapenos (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken Stock (Optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be substituted with another stock, ale, wine, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chilli Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cumin (1/2 of Chilli Powder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oregano (1/2 of Cumin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic Powder (1/2 of Oregano)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pickled garlic, instant garlic, etc are suitable replacements if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow Cooker or Dutch Oven or Pot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stainless Steel Frying Pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender (Optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To emulsify your spices and stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finely dice onions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt the beef tallow in a Dutch Oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add onions and start to fry them slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut your beef to desired size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Separate sausage meat from casings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When onions are soft enough add the meat and desired amount of salt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fry the meat until browned. Ensure sausage meat is broken up and spread around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While meat is frying, toast your chilli powder and cumin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once meat is sufficiently browned, add spices and mix until meat is sufficiently covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Add jalapenos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your stock of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-heat oven to a low-medium temperature. Bring the chilli to the boil and then lower temperature and simmer for about 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place dutch oven in the pre-heated oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow cook until meat is desired texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a tablespoon or two of flour to cold water and mix, add to chilli to thicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve as desired with rice or tortillas, cover with cheese, garnish with red or spring onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NO BEANS!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venison is a good addition, use it as you would beef.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adapting for pot or slow cooker is pretty self-explanatory so I didn&amp;rsquo;t cover it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>I Hate Generative Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-hate-generative-neural-networks/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 01:26:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-hate-generative-neural-networks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have noticed over the past year a creep of images generated using Neural Networking software, referred to by normies as &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; (lol) and I quite simply cannot stand the absolutely soulless and boring nature of it. Every single &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; generated image, video, etc that I have seen is blatantly obvious in its origin. They are always ugly and without any telling features that would be present in something manmade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another observation that I find to be quite telling of the mindset of those that use them as that they are always used in a tasteless manner or in place of an image that would be more appropriate and already exists. For example: an &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; generated image of a character from Lord of the Rings, when there already exists a series of movies, many video games, several art books, countless RPG source books and plenty more examples I could list but you get my point. These works already have an inexhaustible quantity of appropriate high quality images one could use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These technologies are developed using stolen art, music, etc and are seemingly used by people with a confused mindset in which they believe that the image they use needs to be &amp;ldquo;unique&amp;rdquo; to stand out which ironically is not a satisfied condition when the image generated is plagiarizing the work of others and has the exact same weird soulless &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; (lack of) aesthetic that all of these images seemingly have. In the rare cases where these images are convincing at first glance they are always betrayed by their (lack of, or overcompensated) details and once these patterns are noticed they will never pass the test of first glance again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than their boring, hideous and soulless aesthetic these images are generated using stolen artwork taken without permission. Which normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be something I am bothered by as I have no dog in the fight regarding the sanctity of corporate slop. However not all art is corporate slop and not all artists are compensated fairly for their art. Put simply: there are artists that make art I like, I want to see more of their art, their art can only be made by these artists, anything generated using their art as a source is a defacto counterfeit and therefore fraudulent, fraud is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of this technology is an immediate filter as far as I am concerned. Media making use of it isn&amp;rsquo;t worthy of my time because quite simply it isn&amp;rsquo;t real. It has no creative value as it is not creative. A unconvincing masquerade attempting to cover for a lack of talent or inability to dedicate effort to something. I don&amp;rsquo;t like being lied to or having people try to deceive me, I could go on and list many more reasons why I cannot stand this ridiculous facade of an &amp;ldquo;art movement&amp;rdquo; but I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it deserves my time or effort, I have enough self respect not to use these tools to generate my arguments for me and know that what I have said should be more than enough for anyone of a critical thinking mind to grasp the spirit of my points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Salsa</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/salsa/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2024 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/salsa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick recipe for a salsa, this covers the basics of making one and you can adjust it simply and easily. This is intended more as a baseline recipe and you can make whichever changes and additions you please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canned Tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peppers of choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Onions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;White Onions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chilli Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cumin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender (Recommended)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use a Mortar and Pestle but I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering how at this time. (Stay tuned)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throw the tomatoes and garlic into the blender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop peppers and onions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juice your limes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the spices to the blender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now add your onions and peppers in their desired size and call it a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively you can blend them all up with the rest of it for a less chunky salsa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is pretty much just a reminder for myself of what ingredients to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust size of onions, peppers, etc as you please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made this with buffalo sauce in it one time and it was pretty good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/steak-and-ale-stew/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steak and Ale Stew, also known as Guinness Stew is traditional rustic stew from the British Isles, commonly served with mashed or roast potatoes or as part of a pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏲️  Prep time: 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍳 Cooking Time: 2-3 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍽️ Servings: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef Stew Meat
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any roasting cut will do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef Broth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ale
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your favourite Ale or Guinness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bay Leaf, Rosemary, Thyme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut beef into preferred size of chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut carrots into small chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dice onions and celery into tiny pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add butter to your Dutch oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once butter is melted add the onions and fry until translucent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more butter if needed and &amp;ldquo;brown&amp;rdquo; your beef.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once beef is browned on all sides add carrots, celery and spices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix everything around and then add your ale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add beef broth until everything is covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring to the boil, reduce heat to medium and stir and set oven to 160°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once oven is up to heat place the lid on your Dutch oven and place it in your oven.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check after one hour, then every half hour until desired result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can forgo the use of beef broth and use more ale if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to add mustard with the onions and beef. Try it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can thicken the stew as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Yule Fruit Cake</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/yule-fruit-cake/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/yule-fruit-cake/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fruit cake is a traditional Yule / Christmas cake. Versions of it exist throughout Northern Europe. This recipe is for the traditional British style of fruit cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏲️  Prep time: 24 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍳 Cooking Time: 40 - 60 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍽️ Servings: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wet Mix
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almonds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glazed Cherries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Peel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raisins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sultanas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apricots (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figs (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prunes (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry Mix
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almond Flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain Flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allspice, Cinnamon, Cloves, Ginger, Mace, Nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butter Mix
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark Muscovado Sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treacle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirit (Rum or Brandy)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandy will give your cake a fruitier taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rum will give your cake a sweeter taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all ingredients of the Wet Mix in a large mixing bowl and mix until an even distribution is observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your chosen spirit to the Wet Mix. Use an amount that is roughly one quarter of the Wet Mix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix everything until wet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the Wet Mix for at least 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 165°C, prepare enough baking paper for cake or bread tin(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all Dry Mix ingredients and mix in a separate mixing bowl.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proportion spices as you like for taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proportion flours as you like for texture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Butter to a mixing bowl, add the muscovado sugar and beat until creamy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add egg to this if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Dry Mix to the Butter Mix and mix in batches, adding treacle as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the Wet Mix in batches until everything is in the same bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the cake mix to your baking tin(s) and flatten on top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake for 40 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove from the oven and poke the centre with a wooden toothpick or kebab skewer / chopstick.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If clear the cake is done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not then return to oven for 5-10 minutes and check for clean centre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit for 10-15 minutes and then feed the cake with some of your chosen spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When cooled prepare for storage in a cool and dry place, feed the cake once or twice a week with your chosen spirit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 6 weeks the cake is ready to be eaten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add other fruits, spices, etc as you please. This is a &amp;ldquo;rustic&amp;rdquo; recipe intended to use whatever you have or would like to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel free to experiment with the spirit used, mixing the two for the soak or alternating for the feed, etc.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just make sure you do not use a liqueur and you are using a spirit, you do not want to introduce surface sugar to the cake after it has baked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t use eggs in mine as I prefer a dry textured fruit cake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Doner Kebab</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/doner-kebab/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/doner-kebab/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doner Kebab is basically a giant meatball that you cut into slices.
You can use any blend of meat you would like for this recipe, it is not &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;authentic&amp;rdquo; in any way. For this recipe I will be using a blend of lamb and beef as an example but you may use any combination you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏲️  Prep time: 1 hour 20 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍳 Cooking Time: 2 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍽️ Servings: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g Lamb Mince (20% fat content or higher)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g Beef Mince (20% fat content recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;250g Bacon (As much fat as possible) OR Liver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Large Onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coriander&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cumin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oregano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paprika&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food Processor
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For steps requiring a food processor you can do the equivalent by hand. However this recipe is intended to be &amp;ldquo;quick and easy&amp;rdquo; so I will be using a food processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop onion into small chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop bacon into similar sized chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend onion and bacon in food processor until they are a paste like consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add half of your beef mince.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add spices in proportions to your taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add half of your lamb mince.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend until consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add remaining minced meat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blend again until consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pack the meatball tightly in a mixing bowl, cover and freeze for 1 hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove from freezer and work into a &amp;ldquo;kebab shap&amp;rdquo; wrap in aluminium foil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roast in preheated oven at 180°C for 80 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove foil and roast for 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn the kebab over and roast for a further 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kebab is now ready to be sliced and served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can crisp each slice up in a pan if you prefer. (Recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use any blend of meat you would like. For example beef and chicken, lamb and beef, etc. Choose a pairing you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is literally a meatball recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add other spices as you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pairs well with &lt;a href=&#34;../mint-yoghurt-sauce/&#34;&gt;mint yoghurt sauce&lt;/a&gt; or a chilli sauce of your liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use Liver instead of or in addition to the bacon. Just use it where the recipe calls for bacon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Simple Notes Management</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/simple-notes-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/simple-notes-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to start organising my notes more thoroughly and introduced a schema to my notes directory (demonstrated below). I found that this made it more likely for me to utilise my notes, which in turn has saved me a lot of time. I tend to use my notes throughout the day so I found myself needing a means to access them quickly. This is when I made a script. Utilising &lt;code&gt;fd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fzf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xargs&lt;/code&gt; I can now search my notes directory and start taking notes at any given time. It is working really well so far and combined with Neovim I am able to swap between notes files without leaving the comfort of the Neovim editor. If I had to put a number to it I would say that this has saved me at least half an hour a week, which is pretty good for a single line shell command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the schema:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$HOME/Documents/Notes/
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject 1/
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TODO.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject 2/
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TODO.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject 3/
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subject 3.1/
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notes.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;todo.md&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects can be related to a given category of things such as music, food, hobbies, etc or used as a means of categorising further sub-categories of related notes. A lot of these notes files are checklists. I love checklists and while I could use the markdown format of a checklist, that isn&amp;rsquo;t really needed as I tend to delete entries from checklists when they have been met so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a giant list of stuff I no longer need to take note of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These notes can be synced between devices using &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syncthing&lt;/code&gt; but I have had no need to implement this due to maintaining a paper notebook as my main means of notetaking. Anything important enough to need to access it on the go is already on paper and I take it with me everywhere anyway. I maintain and use a paper notebook for most of my note taking. I transfer my written notes to this system to index them. The way that I take notes in my paper notebooks is different and will maybe get it&amp;rsquo;s own post at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keep-it-simple-stupid&#34;&gt;Keep It Simple, Stupid!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While talking to a friend about this subject they mentioned that they use software specifically designed for this purpose, which I found odd since notes are just text files. They told me about Obsidian, a graphical markdown text editor that connects notes together with links and has plugin support and all kinds of bloated features that you do not need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a monolithic solution to something as simple as note taking is rather funny to think about. Especially when it offers nothing useful on top of its main feature i.e. being a notebook on your computer. A lot of these software applications have popped up over the years and yet none of them have offered anything unique or useful. I remember my university pushing Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s OneNote as the perfect note taking solution as if a text file or document file wouldn&amp;rsquo;t suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to the one argument in favour of these tools that I see repeated most often. That being that they support some form of sync between devices. This is not a unique feature either, syncing files between devices is easily done. Cloud storage exists already for people that don&amp;rsquo;t want a DIY solution, sync tools exist for those that do. Including a file sync that is proprietary to the notes editor is a clear case of inventing problems to sell a solution. It is fundamentally worse in all regards than utilising tools that already exist for this purpose. Monolithic design for the sake of self-justification in a note taking program is insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest solutions are always the best, which is why I find this whole world of note taking software redundant. Any notes worth taking don&amp;rsquo;t need an entire suite of software to handle. Just write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Projects Update</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/projects-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2023 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/projects-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on a few project recently and thought I would give an update to what they are and how they are coming along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;migrating-from-vim-to-neovim&#34;&gt;Migrating from Vim to Neovim&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty self explanatory, Vim has served me well over the years but having to maintain my config in vimscript and trying to manage packages and plugins for it is too much work for what I get out of it. As such I have chosen to move to Neovim and start using it. My progress with this can be tracked on my dotfiles repo if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cross-platform-dotfile-management&#34;&gt;Cross platform dotfile management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use multiple systems for my computing needs, GNU+Linux for my desktops, servers, ThinkPads and MacOS for my Mac. There are differences between these two that require micro-management and changes when deploying dotfiles as such I have chosen to start modelling a new way of managing my dotfiles. For now this is in the planning stages and will be rolled out as I see fit and implement my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-website-design&#34;&gt;New website design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is my little space on the internet where I scream into the void. It&amp;rsquo;s great being able to post and publish things and share them around and get feedback, etc. One of my favourite parts of being in control of this website is that I can post and publish what I would like. However the issue of organising the content on the site has come to my attention recently. The cookbook section should be it&amp;rsquo;s own &amp;ldquo;website&amp;rdquo; within the same domain for example. Categories and tags should be more distinct, sorting things by year on the index pages doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to me either. As such I plan to make a few design changes to the website over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently these are the changes I plan to make:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categorise content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookbook migrated to it&amp;rsquo;s own website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New content types (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimise image usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Social&amp;rdquo; links 🤔&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-content&#34;&gt;New content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to expand the content that I write on this site to include things I would like to write about but didn&amp;rsquo;t think would suit the site in its current design. Now that I will be changing the design that excuse is no longer valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New content may include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More blogging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More guides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In regards to reviews, I came to the conclusion that writing about the music I listen to or the video games I play or the books I read could be useful to some people. After all I do seem to be asked quite frequently about what I think about a given product or band, etc. I would also like to review some of the camping gear I have acquired recently as this information is useful in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bots-are-fun&#34;&gt;Bots are fun&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been developing a bot that I intend to use as a means to bridge various platforms together that I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or patience to manually keep up to date with. I don&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be great, it is a personal project intended to teach me how to interact with APIs and other tool sets. But it is a fun little project so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brewing&#34;&gt;Brewing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making my own wine, beer and cider has been a great hobby so far and I having been gaining a lot more experience with it. Learning the various ways that different ingredients interact, which yeast to use, how long to do things for and why. It is a great hobby and doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a lot of time to do. Although the learning curve can be somewhat of an issue depending on what you plan to do. I plan to write about my experiences with brewing alcohol at some point but for now I just wanted to update that is an ongoing hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;power-lifting&#34;&gt;Power lifting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have returned to the gym and have taken up a power lifting programming again. I have always enjoyed this sport and intend to last a lot longer at it this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s about everything. Thanks for reading and if you are interested in anything I have mentioned feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/contact&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tomato Sauce</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/tomato-sauce/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/tomato-sauce/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe for a general purpose tomato sauce that can be used for pasta dishes, as a base for other sauces, a dipping sauce or any practical application you would find for a tomato sauce!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x Cans of Tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basil (Fresh preferred but dried is fine.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic (Fresh preferred. Powder, salt or &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; garlic is fine.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peel and crush garlic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour the oil into a pan or pot and bring to a medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add garlic to the pan and fry until the garlic starts to brown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove the garlic from the pan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tip the pot to one side and add the canned tomatoes to the top such that the tomatoes and their juices will roll into the oil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir occasionally to prevent burning while bringing it to the boil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep stirring to prevent burning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add basil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove from the heat and allow to cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now store the sauce or use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add tomato puree to the sauce whilst boiling to thicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) After cooling, you can leave the sauce covered with a towel to ferment over night before storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Running OpenMW Through Steam</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/running-openmw-through-steam/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 12:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/running-openmw-through-steam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is one of the finest video games ever made. It is one of my favourites and as such I like to have it installed on all of my computers. I prefer to play the game using the OpenMW source port but would still like to use Steam features like game time tracking, screenshot sharing and the overlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow this guide, you should have the Steam version of Morrowind and OpenMW already installed on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your Steam library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on &amp;lsquo;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&amp;rsquo; in your games list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;lsquo;Properties&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Launch Options enter the path to OpenMW inside of single quotes followed by &lt;code&gt;-- %command%&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example &lt;code&gt;&#39;/usr/bin/openmw&#39; -- %command%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open your Steam library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on &amp;lsquo;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&amp;rsquo; in your games list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;lsquo;Properties&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Launch Options enter the path to OpenMW inside of double quotes followed by &lt;code&gt; %command%&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;C:\Games\OpenMW\openmw.exe %command%&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now launch OpenMW via Steam by clicking Play on your Morrowind entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trick will work for other games too. For example Daggerfall Unity, DOOM and DOOM 2 and your personal favourite source port(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I am aware you can&amp;rsquo;t do this to track game time for Morrowind on a Mac as Steam won&amp;rsquo;t let you launch the game even if you manage to get it to download the game files via a manifest file or console commands.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cranmeode - Cranberry Mead</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/cranmeode/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/cranmeode/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an updated version of my old Cranmeode recipe, this version is vastly superior in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 litres of Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1kg honey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;300-650g Cranberries (More or less to adjust flavour, I recommend ~450g for a first batch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeast (I recommend Lalvin EC-1118)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40g Oil Free Raisins per 100g Cranberries (Optional) (Recommended, helps to balance cranberry flavour)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fermentation Vessel (1 gallon demijohn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syphon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your yeast in warm water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add honey to fermentation vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil 2 litres of water and add to a pot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the cranberries and raisins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stir until the fluid goes dark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow to simmer (do not boil) for about 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add cold water to reduce temperature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the pot aside and allow to cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the mixture is blood temperature or lower add the yeast and mix together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the fluid to the fermentation vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the yeast and shake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow to ferment until the yeast is finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now bottle your mead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This recipe is proportional, if you want a smaller batch, adjust each ingredient by the same fraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Sourdough Starter</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/sourdough-starter/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/sourdough-starter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sourdough bread requires a bit of maintenance unlike notmal white bread. You need to make a starter in advance and maintain it so that you can use it when needed. You can maintain these starters for years, once you have one going you can use it whenever you need. Just be sure not to deplete it or you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain or bread flour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add one teaspoon of sugar to a jar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add three heaped tablespoons of flour to the jar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add enough water to cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix this together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loosely cover the jar with a towel, do not put the lid on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next day it should have a smell to it now and some bubbles, feed it with two heaped tablespoons of flour to the jar and enough water to cover. Mix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the next few days repeat the above feeding process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After five days your starter should be ready for use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now store and use as needed. Remember to feed it before use and to feed it occasionally (every dau is not required at this point) to keep it alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to experiment with sourdough starters and see what works for you.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The recipe on &lt;a href=&#34;https://based.cooking/sourdough-starter/&#34;&gt;based.cooking&lt;/a&gt; has some good tips and advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure not to feed it with sugar and to only use sugar on the first day.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar is not a necessary step but I find it works for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A Blog Without Blogging</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/a-blog-without-blogging/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/a-blog-without-blogging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started this blog it was purely as an exercise in staking my e-claim on my e-land as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/watch?v=3dIVesHEAzc&#34;&gt;meme at the time&lt;/a&gt; suggested. It was a fun exercise that let me refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS and it led me to learn Hugo too and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting to this site whenever I feel like something I&amp;rsquo;ve written is worth posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much blogging, in fact I&amp;rsquo;ve done basically none at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to change that. The idea of writing a blog is appealing I&amp;rsquo;ve just never felt like I had anything interesting going on. I blame doing a CompSci degree for this though. Now that I am doing a degree that I actually want to do I have probably too much that I want to write down about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When last semester ended I planned to blog about my experience, what I thought of the various classes, the campus, the environment of the university in general but I never got around to it. So I will cover both semesters at the same time when this one is finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact there is a bunch of stuff I would like to start writing about that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to. Such as book reviews, travel logs and personal updates. The idea of &amp;ldquo;building your own platform&amp;rdquo; was supposed to give the opportunity to do these things and I never took advantage of it when I wanted to. I will be doing so more often starting now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sima - Finnish Lemon Mead</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/sima/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/sima/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe for making Sima, which is a Finnish lemon mead drink. I learned it from my Finnish flatmate at uni so it is 100% trad approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5 litres of Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Unwaxed Lemons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;900g honey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeast of choice. (I recommend Lalvin EC-1118)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil Free Raisins (Optional) (Recommended)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment&#34;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fermentation Vessel (1 gallon demijohn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syphon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your yeast in warm water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash, zest and juice lemons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add lemon zest and honey to a pot or bucket.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional: You may add raisins at this stage for more raisin flavour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boil 2 litres of water and add to the honey mixture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix the honey and boiling water until it is one fluid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the remainder of the water to reduce temperature and thin the &amp;ldquo;syrup&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the lemon juice and stir until it is a runny liquid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue stirring and wait for the fluid to reach blood temperature or colder (safe range for your yeast).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add yeast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour the liquid into your fermentation vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow to ferment until the yeast is finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now bottle the Sima.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now carbonate the Sima using your preferred method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This recipe is proportional, if you want a smaller batch, adjust each ingredient by the same fraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use a combination of sugar and honey if you want to keep the cost down.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If doing so I recommend Muscovado sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Cookbook Now Live</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/cookbook-now-live/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cookbook is now live. You can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a separate RSS feed from the one for blog posts. You may need to adjust your existing RSS link as I made some changes to that on the back end. You can find the most up to date versions of the RSS links at the bottom of this page and on the cookbook page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cookbook is a bit barren right now but I figured it was better have it public than not at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy cooking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overnight Oats</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/overnight-oats/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 14:00:30 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/overnight-oats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overnight oats is a nice easy alternative to porridge that you eat cold instead. A very simple dish to make and can be supplemented with various additions to increase taste, macros and texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my personal way of making it, you will find hundreds of ways of doing it online though, experiment until you find what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏲️ Prep time: 5 min&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍽️ Servings: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolled Oats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whey Protein Powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek Yoghurt (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fruit of choice (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure out your preferred serving of oats. Add to a glass or cup.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to go for a good couple of handfuls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add one serving of whey protein powder to the oats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this stage you can add other things you like to it. I sometimes add cinnamon or nutmeg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pour milk until oats and whey are covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix together until whey powder is evenly distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add more milk as needed, you want to cover the dry ingredients entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover the glass or cup with cling film and place in the fridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the morning you will now have overnight oats.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on how much milk you used you will now find either:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A peanut butter like consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A milkshake like consistency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something in between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimenting is key until you find the right consistency for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now add Yoghurt to the top. (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may now add your fruit of choice to the yoghurt. (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use many different kinds of ingredients when making this. I plan to update this recipe when I find interesting additions and alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a 100% whey protein powder, absent of soy, pea and other &amp;ldquo;proteins&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add whatever you like to this, the key with this is experimenting and finding what you like.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to switch whey flavours around, sometimes I add some chocolate, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Against CDNs</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/against-cdns/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/against-cdns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Delivery Networks or CDNs for short are a common means for sourcing libraries and frameworks into a web page without having to provide a local copy on the server. It helps cut down on bandwidth and resource usage when serving web content. Which sounds like a great deal for the webmaster. To be fair, it pretty much is a great deal but only for the webmaster and the CDN provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When clients connect to a website and pull JQuery or Bootstrap or some other framework from a CDN instead of the web server serving the page contents they are being tracked. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a very good deal for the user. CDN data can be used to track users around the web without the use of cookies, just by requesting the library from a CDN you are providing an awful lot of metadata without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why it is important to minimize your exposure to sites and services that use these. Of course that means 90% of the web is probably no longer usable. It is important to be smart about it at the least. Should you use social media websites such as Facebook they already know who you are, the frameworks they use are served by them too. Your exposure to request tracking doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter in this scenario since you are already using Facebook. Which you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use if you value your privacy. Although it is possible to use Facebook without exposing your web usage to them, that is for another post, another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s say for example you like to read web blogs like mine. Hopefully they serve those frameworks, etc from their own server. You should check to be sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is served entirely in static HTML and CSS documents so there is no frameworks being loaded at all. However I encourage that you check right now anyway. After all I could be lying (I&amp;rsquo;m not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that a blog you enjoy reading is using CDNs to serve frameworks, libraries, etc to your browser consider asking the admin to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Having Fun Is Trad</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/having-fun-is-trad/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/having-fun-is-trad/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that e-trads have been crusading against fun. Interestingly they do so on the Internet, which is a curious choice of battleground for such a subject. I have absolutely no idea why they are doing this or what they think they will achieve. The most confusing detail of this trend is that having fun is in fact trad so what&amp;rsquo;s with the intentional friendly fire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days people either treat fun as a part of everyday life (which it is), as an excuse to waste their time (addiction cope) or as an evil to be conquered (the cringe take). It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly strange to see the latter take from people that call themselves &amp;rsquo;traditionalists&amp;rsquo; as these are the very same people that strive to return to some kind of societal normality. In normal societies people had fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is full of examples of people having fun, be it feasting with friends and neighbors or dancing around a fire or in a ballroom. One could argue that these traditional forms of fun don&amp;rsquo;t exist anymore, they would be wrong of course. Quite commonly you will find if you try hard to look in the first place that there are plenty of opportunities to do these things already and if that somehow yields zero results for you then the problem is that you aren&amp;rsquo;t organising it yourself. However this doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain the aversion to fun that a lot of trads seem to have developed recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real problem that some of these people have isn&amp;rsquo;t people having fun, it&amp;rsquo;s the ways that people have fun. Particularly the habit forming excesses of it that lead to a loss of enjoyment but an addictive desire that compels participation when any joy to be found is already dead. So is the issue that fun is bad or that having fun is no longer fun? I&amp;rsquo;d wager it&amp;rsquo;s the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of habit forming fun is video games, they are formulaic in design, particularly to extract as much of your time as possible. Where is the fun to be found when these video games become a part time (or even a full time) job? If you have to commit yourself to something that used to be possible to just pick up and play you will find yourself drained of enjoyment very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major problem with people playing video games is excess. People play them way too much, they revolve their lives around them until they stop being fun and become a chore. They play these video games alone in their bedroom for hours or even days at a time in some cases and what do they get out of it? An ever decreasing dopamine rush when the shiny and sparkly effects flare off when you do the same chore (and that is what a lot of video game content is these days) for the thousandth time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with having some fun on your own of course, I find myself enjoying a book quite often. Books are trad right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just video games that masquerade as fun whilst in actual fact being nothing more than addictive distraction. Television, YouTube, TikTok, etc all fulfill this role as well. Since consumption of these is entirely passive the victims of addiction don&amp;rsquo;t even need to think about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s make a distinction between fun and distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun is when you enjoy yourself. A distraction is when you occupy your time. To quote anti-gambling PSAs &amp;ldquo;when the fun stops STOP!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t owe distractions any of your time, that time belong to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally when someone had free time they spent it with other people, or learning a new skill, reading a book or just getting in some extra rest. Fun was enjoyable in the moment and benefited you in some way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun is an ancient and primordial experience that has been twisted and turned into a control mechanism, you can reject it any time you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you can&amp;rsquo;t have fun playing video games, or watching YouTube, etc but you have to be aware that they are built on algorithms and design standards to keep you engaged with them and not with something else. Time is money and they are draining you of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a bare minimum if you want to have fun find a hobby. Dedicate time to it every week, if after a while you don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it then find a new one. Repeat this until you are having fun. Don&amp;rsquo;t fall for the trap of wasting time to pass time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your grandfathers went to the pub, the tavern and the mead hall on Thunorsday. You sit on a couch. Who do you think had more fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t fun, the problem is a lack of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Domain Name Change Update</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/domain-name-change-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 18:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/domain-name-change-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have decided against the use of the &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt; TLD for the site and will be returning to tradition and using the &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; TLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reasoning for choosing the &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; TLD over &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt; is twofold. The &lt;code&gt;xyz&lt;/code&gt; TLD more accurately represents the end of the internet theme and it is much cheaper which fits with the minimalist theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update will occur at some point in the coming days. The current domain will continue to work until it expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS feeds should continue to work on the old domain once the domain change occurs. Once the old domain expires however it will no longer update. Please update your RSS feeds to reflect the new domain. The new feed can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/index.xml&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email will change to the new domain at some point in the future too. I will make sure to update the site when this occurs. For now assume that the &lt;code&gt;w@dunkelheit.biz&lt;/code&gt; address is no longer functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please update your RSS, email contacts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Introduction to Git Etiquette</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/an-introduction-to-git-etiquette/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/an-introduction-to-git-etiquette/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git Etiquette is an interesting subject and one that I found myself having to teach my classmates often. Which I enjoyed because teaching is the greatest way to learn. (Apparently)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply it is the practice of standardising the way you manage your repo and how you communicate regarding things inside of the repo and generally for the purpose of making sure you don&amp;rsquo;t get conflicts, errors and other disasters that lead to development down time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I like to teach Git Etiquette is to introduce a schema and then give examples of how to operate within this schema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;schema&#34;&gt;Schema&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical schema that was used on team projects at University was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-diagram&#34; data-lang=&#34;diagram&#34;&gt;b-bug-name          |   Bug branches
doc-document-name   |   Documentation branches
f-feature-name      |   Feature branches
master              |   Master branch
t-test-name         |   Testing branches
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed us to see at a glance what was going on in a branch without having to ask someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would then give examples of how to create branches, switch to them and back, give proper commit messages and other basic Git usage. The hour or so it takes to teach all of this at the start saves you immeasurable time later and keeps everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;semi-automated-project-management&#34;&gt;Semi-Automated Project Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we made sure to use the GitHub issues tracker, personally I am not a fan of this but it was a reasonable compromise to make for the sake of the team&amp;rsquo;s comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merge and pull requests went through a two person verification stage to make sure we caught any issues before pulling them into the master branch. This was very effective. One developer would verify the contents of the commit and then escalate to the leader of his team or the project so that the users that could push to master was limited to those that were responsible for the project going smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an extremely effective means for us to keep everything flowing and smooth. With minor hiccups along the way when someone needed help with using Git as there are many people with zero experience of Git or similar software at University and not all Universities have classes on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-etiquette-and-you&#34;&gt;Git Etiquette and You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a good chance that only some, perhaps none of the above will be perfectly applicable to your project(s). That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing, your schema and management rules must apply to the scope of your project after all. You may need more branch naming schemes than this, you may need more layers of verification. The important thing is to have a set of rules set out when you start so that events can flow into the desired workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Steak Tartare</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/steak-tartare/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/recipes/steak-tartare/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an exact copy of my Steak Tartare recipe from &lt;a href=&#34;https://based.cooking/&#34;&gt;based.cooking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steak Tartare is a dish prepared using raw ground / minced beef and egg yolk. A popular dish in Europe, this recipe is a good stepping stone into the world of raw meats, organs and pates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⏲️ Prep time: 10 min&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍽️ Servings: 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground Beef (Lean as possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onion or Shallots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gherkin / Cornichons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parsley (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ketchup (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mustard (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worcestershire Sauce (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;directions&#34;&gt;Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dice your onions or shallots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finely slice your cornichons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinse, drain and chop your capers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop parsley. (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chop ground beef into smaller pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the above to a mixing bowl and mix with hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add ketchup, mustard or Worcestershire sauce as needed and mix further. (Optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate an egg yolk from the whites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loosely roll some of the mixture into a ball in your hand and place onto a plate and press softly to form a bowl shape, add egg yolk to indentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve, you may now add salt and pepper as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>VPNs Are Not Private</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/vpns-are-not-private/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 07:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/vpns-are-not-private/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common misconception you will see repeated online is that VPNs make everything you do online &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo;. The people repeating this myth are unfortunate victims of advertising psyops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to VPNs having active advertising campaigns on television, they make outright claims in said advertisements that are simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be obvious that any product that can advertise itself on television doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually offer &amp;ldquo;privacy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo; which of course they vaguely define and redefine as needed to sell you on their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPN services effectively have two main features and that&amp;rsquo;s it, anything beyond them is marketing. These are packet / protocol obfuscation and bypassing region locks or ISP blocking. Any claims to &amp;ldquo;privacy&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;security&amp;rdquo; are poorly defined and assume that the user in question is an expert on internet protocols, fingerprinting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can VPNs be used for privacy? Yes. Do VPNs offer privacy out of the box? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, using a VPN service as is for all of your web traffic makes you easier to track as it is another piece of metadata that can be used to identify you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a VPN out of the box but then using it for everything tells every service you connect to that you are on a VPN, which VPN it is and that you use it for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some valid uses of a VPN service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bypassing your ISP / University network rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding your IP address when using Peer To Peer services.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such as torrents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bypassing a region lock for web content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide where you are if you decide to go abroad but continue to &amp;ldquo;work from home&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are still valid uses for VPNs but for anything privacy or security related you need to know what you are doing. Otherwise you just make yourself a bigger target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VPNs are useful tools and have valid uses, they can be used for privacy if you know what you are doing. Just be careful which one you pick and how you use it. Many VPN companies are owned by companies or in territories that are hostile to a free internet. Always research what you are buying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Encrypting an External Storage Device</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/encrypting-an-external-storage-device/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 09:20:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/encrypting-an-external-storage-device/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to keep backups of important data, it&amp;rsquo;s an even better idea to make sure only you can access them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide on how to encrypt an external storage device for use on a Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;storage-devices&#34;&gt;Storage Devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide should be relatively universal for most external storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example I am assuming you know what kind of storage device is best for your use case and that you are using a NEW device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&#34;color:red;&#34;&gt;Important Notice:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using a device that you have used previously you may wish to securely wipe all data on it first. I do not have a guide for this at this time. I will update this post in the future if that changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need the following to follow this guide along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer running a GNU/Linux operating system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An external storage device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;cryptsetup&lt;/code&gt; package installed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name may vary based on distro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;encrypting-the-device&#34;&gt;Encrypting The Device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-find-your-devices-path&#34;&gt;1. Find your device&amp;rsquo;s path.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do so with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo fdisk -l
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output of this command will list information about each storage device connected to your computer. Such as it&amp;rsquo;s total capacity in GiB units and the model number. You can use this information to determine which disk is the one you intend to write to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point forward I will be referring to this device as /dev/sdx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-set-up-partition-table&#34;&gt;2. Set up partition table.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most drives when purchased will come with the msdos partition table, you don&amp;rsquo;t need this for a Linux machine. The following command will change it to use the GPT partition table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo parted /dev/sdx mklabel gpt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive now has the GPT partition table format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-creating-a-luks-device&#34;&gt;3. Creating a LUKS device.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now create the LUKS device. Using the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdx
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it will ask you for a password and to confirm it. I assume you know how to choose a strong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-mapping-the-device&#34;&gt;4. Mapping the device.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will now mount the device to the mapper. This allows us to use it like a normal storage device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will want to name the device at this stage, we will refer to your given name as DevName from here on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdx DevName
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device is now available for usage as a normal storage device would be if it were unmounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-formatting-the-device&#34;&gt;5. Formatting the device.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage we will be formatting the device as the ext4 Linux format. To do that we run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/DevName
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device now has the ext4 format and can be mounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mounting-the-device&#34;&gt;Mounting The Device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage you can mount the device the way you normally would an external device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use your GUI file manager such as &lt;code&gt;pcmanfam&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dolphin&lt;/code&gt; to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also do the following to open it using the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-repeat-step-4-above-mapping-the-device&#34;&gt;1. Repeat step 4 above. (Mapping the device)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can skip this if it is still mapped from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-mount-the-drive&#34;&gt;2. Mount the drive.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now mount the device as you would normally do so for an external device via the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo mount /dev/mapper/DevName &amp;lt;/path/to/mount/point/&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;unmounting-the-device&#34;&gt;Unmounting the device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-unmounting-the-drive&#34;&gt;1. Unmounting the drive.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can unmount the drive using the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo umount &amp;lt;/path/to/mount/point&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-unmapping-the-device&#34;&gt;2. Unmapping the device.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can unmap the device using the following command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo cryptsetup luksClose DevName
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now safely remove the device from the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you prefer to use a graphical file manager then you should use one.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact for external devices I recommend doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use other formats for the disk if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Bitcoin and Monero Extremism</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/bitcoin-monero-extremism/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/bitcoin-monero-extremism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;postmeme&#34; style=&#34;max-height: 240px;&#34; src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/bitcoin-monero-extremism/monero-pilled.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34; title=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Bitcoin maximalist but I am also a Monero extremist. These positions aren&amp;rsquo;t mutually exclusive. In fact these two technologies combined solve the problems of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-cash-digital-gold&#34;&gt;Digital Cash, Digital Gold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems almost inevitable at this point that Bitcoin will overtake Gold as the strongest (in terms of market cap) store of wealth. Bitcoin is the new gold standard 😉 for storing wealth but it&amp;rsquo;s not very good at being money any more (just like gold). Due to high transaction fees and currency speculation it is better to not use your Bitcoin and to just HODL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are emergent technologies trying to solve this problem like the lightning network there are some issues regarding anonymity and privacy that makes traditional cash superior for transacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Monero comes in. Being the only cryptocurrency that allows for transactions to be both anonymous and private, Monero functions almost exactly like physical cash does, except digitally and without out of control money printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero can be swapped for Bitcoin using decentralised platforms too meaning you do not require the traditional finance system to acquire it. There is also the experimental technology of atomic swaps that allows private chain-to-chain transactions to swap one crypto for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons Bitcoin and Monero are the only cryptocurrencies that have legitimate use cases as currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility-tokens&#34;&gt;Utility Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other cryptocurrencies that aren&amp;rsquo;t shitcoins but these are mostly utility tokens such as the Brave foundation&amp;rsquo;s BAT (Basic Attention Token) and Namecoin. But as utility tokens these function as a means to an end and not as a form of savings or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proof-of-stake---proof-of-shitcoin&#34;&gt;Proof of stake - Proof of shitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof of stake is anti-crypto. It allows for the largest bag holders to control the network and takes the decentralisation of proof of work away. Making transactions censorable and the currency defacto non-fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;muh-power-usage&#34;&gt;Muh power usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most energy alarmism this is a non-issue. If you understand how electric power is generated and how much of it goes to waste due to fluctuations in demand then you will see that Bitcoin actually incentivises energy innovation and prevents waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this is demonstrated in real life Bitcoin mining practices. Countries with cheap electricity get more Bitcoin mining operations in them which brings more money into the local economy as well as incentivising said means of creating energy. El Salvador plans to mine Bitcoin using geothermal for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to explain how Bitcoin mining reduces waste is that miners seeking the highest return on their investment will go where the energy is cheapest and most abundant, leaving the places were it is more costly and limited. This effectively allows for excess energy production in one part of the world to be utilised elsewhere by proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-friends-into-crypto&#34;&gt;Getting friends into crypto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting friends and family into crypto can be difficult. A cool trick I found is to get them to install a wallet app, send them a small amount (about $5 worth) and show them how easy it is to use by sending it back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to show and not tell, especially when trying to explain bleeding edge technologies. However you will want to make sure that person you are introducing cryptocurrencies to understands the importance of self custody, securing their devices, backing up their seed phrases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will be technically competent enough to do all of this which is fine. If this is the case then you will need to adjust as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is easiest to get people into as it has brand recognition and is the easiest to acquire. It also has a reputation of being &amp;ldquo;internet stocks&amp;rdquo; which attracts the wrong kind of attitude sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero is harder to recommend to people as most people that get into crypto just want gains and don&amp;rsquo;t see the point in using it as money when they can use money. I understand this position and why it is held, which is why I generally only recommend Monero to people that are already internet present. That is not to say however that I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to people anyway, just that if they have no real use for it then they will be better off just buying some Bitcoin sats instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact one thing that Monero is excellent for is teaching someone the basics of how cryptocurrencies work with real life examples but without breaking the bank. It is also good at giving people an idea of how other cryptocurrencies aren&amp;rsquo;t private or anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating QR Codes for Crypto</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a blog or a website or have any kind of online presence then you should be accepting crypto donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain why you should accept crypto here because &lt;a href=&#34;https://landchad.net/crypto&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; exists. Please read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crypto-addresses&#34;&gt;Crypto Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to use third party platforms to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need is your address and you are good to go. In this example I will be assuming that you have custody of your crypto wallet(s) and don&amp;rsquo;t use fiat-crypto™️ platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example I will be using a Monero address but the same method will work for all cryptocurrencies that use a single-string address. Which &lt;a href=&#34;#tips&#34;&gt;all two&lt;/a&gt; of the important ones do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all you are going to want to know your Crypto receive address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this for Monero: &lt;code&gt;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly you are going to want to install the &lt;code&gt;python-qrcode&lt;/code&gt; package. It is available under this name on Arch and Debian based distros. It can also be &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/&#34;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have these two tools you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generating-the-qr-code&#34;&gt;Generating the QR code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the following into your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with your actual address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will now have a png image file in your current directory. You can now use this on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of it in use see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/donate&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-use-this-program&#34;&gt;Why Use This Program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be considering using an online QR code generator. But any code running on someone else&amp;rsquo;s hardware cannot be trusted with something as sensitive as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an advanced user you can use this tool with optimisation options or you can output your QR code to an SVG instead. You can use this in combination with other QR code optimisation tools to minimize the file size if that is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two cryptocurrencies actually matter these are Bitcoin and Monero. All other cryptos are gambling or memes (or a dangerous combination of both). &lt;strong&gt;Not financial advice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always give the user the option to donate with the address itself too. In fact its a good idea to provide the address with the QR code so that they can verify the QR resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be a good idea to create a minimalist solution to allow the user to expand the page with the given QR codes if you plan to include them on other pages on your site. This is only relevant if your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t accommodate for this in its design anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Bloating Your Shell</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/stop-bloating-your-shell/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/stop-bloating-your-shell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably my favourite part of using Linux is that I can customise my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customisation options for some of the fundamental tools I use are endless and they are customisable by design. I have probably spent more time customising, modifying and tweaking my shell configurations than any other piece of software on my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this article I will be using &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as the example shell unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-shell-is-a-tool-not-a-toy&#34;&gt;A shell is a tool, not a toy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put the shell is a tool. Whether you are using it interactively or you are scripting tasks, you must use your shell correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the shell is a tool you should be more concerned with what it is for than how it looks. You should also be aware of the dangers of using it incorrectly and the dangers of misunderstanding it while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shells support a form of regex which allows you to be as explicit or implicit as you need when creating a command to be run. The use of the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; on its own in shell scripts should be avoided for this reason. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to accidentally delete your entire home folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-dont-need-plugin-managers&#34;&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Plugin Managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of plugin managers for a shell is peak soydev and a completely ridiculous concept, so why do so many people fall for it? The answer is simple, they are soydevs and do not understand the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular plugin manager seems to be &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; shell. It is nothing more than an obfuscated fronted for features that are built into &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;. You do not need it to install anything. You can &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; these plugins manually in your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these managers makes your shell take longer to load, adds unneeded complexity and causes problems if you want to do something outside of its scope. Not only that but it turns your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file into a complete and utter mess for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop using them, you don&amp;rsquo;t need them. It&amp;rsquo;s lazy and encourages bad practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-your-own-plugins&#34;&gt;Make your own plugins!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a ridiculous number of aliases? Would you prefer not to scroll through them? You can make these into their own plugin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above with how to load a plugin you simply need to source the plugin file. Plugin files for &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; are actually just &lt;code&gt;.zsh&lt;/code&gt; files and you can make your own. All you need to do is place your aliases in a new file, place the file somewhere appropriate, ensure that the file&amp;rsquo;s shebang is correct: &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/zsh&lt;/code&gt; and then source that file in the .zshrc file like so:
&lt;code&gt;source /path/to/new/alias/plugin.zsh 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t do this with my aliases and would recommend not doing so but this is a good example of how plugins work, they are just &lt;code&gt;.zsh&lt;/code&gt; scripts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aliasing-correctly&#34;&gt;Aliasing correctly.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliases are probably my favourite part of using the shell for most of my needs. You can ensure that a command such as &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; always uses colours, you can create adjacently named commands such as &lt;code&gt;ll&lt;/code&gt; for example to run &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally you can bind scripts and long and complicated single line commands to a single word for ease of use. For example I use &lt;code&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; for managing my dotfiles git repository, I have some scripts that I also like to invoke for things such as checking for updates from all programs on my system, checking crypto prices, etc that I can do with a single word instead of writing the full file path. Although I do I keep these scripts in my &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; I use a naming convention that makes it easier to tell what script it is but it is easier to just invoke them with an alias instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing you should not do with aliases however is use them to replace a program. It is bad practice to &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; a core program such as &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; with an alternative you found online. You should instead be using this tool by its name so that you are aware of what you are doing. Using aliases to obfuscate what you are doing is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shebang&#34;&gt;Shebang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shebang (shell bang) is used to ensure that the correct shell language is used when a file is run. For example &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; would be used if a script is POSIX compliant only and uses no Non-POSIX commands. For example if you write a script in &lt;code&gt;BASH&lt;/code&gt; and it uses bashisms, then your shebang should be &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the shebang in your scripts correctly means that when you invoke them from another shell the correct shell program is used to interpret the script. There are tools for testing your shell scripts so that you know what shebang to use, what adjustments to make to use, etc. I personally quite like &lt;code&gt;shellcheck&lt;/code&gt; but there are other options out there. However you should not rely on these tools and should be familiar with the commands you are using and how they work before committing them to a script. You can always check their man pages or other documentation before you commit to their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally all scripts should be POSIX compliant only, bashisms are very tempting to use as they do give you more options for your script but there is a good chance you just do not need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remote-shells&#34;&gt;Remote Shells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you connect to other devices using a tool like &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; then you should ensure that the remote user&amp;rsquo;s shell config is configured correctly for this. A few examples of what not to do are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invocation of programs with &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard declaring terminal (and emulator) compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting background processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-recommendations&#34;&gt;Additional recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When declaring your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable you should do so explicitly, it may seem fun to use a script to do this but that is additional startup logic that you do not need and a script that you now need to maintain. Additionally you should not be declaring the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file it should be declared in your &lt;code&gt;.zprofile&lt;/code&gt; file so that your application launcher (assuming dmenu) is &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of using a script that iterates through all the sub-directories of your &lt;code&gt;.local/bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory just declare them like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/go&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/sh&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example is from my &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file, which you can find here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/wdunkelheit/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/zsh/.zshrc&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-process&#34;&gt;Learning process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, using the shell is a learning process. The more you use it and tinker with it they more you will learn. Feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/contact&#34;&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt; about this subject if you would like help or would like to correct anything I have said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Emacs Rabbit Hole</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/the-emacs-rabbit-hole/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/the-emacs-rabbit-hole/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Emacs as my text editor for about a year now. I still have no idea what I am doing but at least I know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosy-and-powerful&#34;&gt;Cosy and Powerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emacs client is very lightweight and it can be self-extended whilst running by using Elisp. I am not quite sure how it works as Elisp is too far down the rabbit hole and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is very modular to the point that you can use it as an entire operating system if you so choose. It can be used as a windowing manager, a web browser, an email client. Not bad for a text editor right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believe that this makes Emacs monolithic but that is due to a misconception that Emacs itself is doing all of these things and not the independent Elisp and C programs running within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago I learned that you can run Emacs as a server, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what purpose this would have but it sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vim-gang&#34;&gt;Vim gang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to using Emacs I used Vim as my editor of choice. I still do for single file editing. I love the Vim keybindings, macros, instruction language, etc. So when I heard that you can use these in Emacs with Evil mode I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-year-later&#34;&gt;One Year Later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I have found to be the most impressive about Emacs after a year of use is how it just &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo; in a minimalist way. There&amp;rsquo;s no bells and whistles, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to use my mouse for anything. Once it has been launched it is ready to go, my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Evil mode in Emacs and it is indistinguishable from using Vim in a terminal except I am no longer held back by any limitations built into a given terminal emulator. At first I missed being unable to use Alt key for quick normal mode instructions but I have since rebound my keyboard to be more Emacs compatible and find the Emacs way of doing things more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to try Emacs tools such as &lt;code&gt;magit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmail&lt;/code&gt; but this is mostly due to wanting to wait until I learn Emacs properly. Speaking of which&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-off-the-training-wheels&#34;&gt;Taking off the training wheels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn Emacs from scratch, as it stands for the last year I have not been using Emacs &amp;ldquo;correctly&amp;rdquo; in the sense that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using it in a way that allows me to learn how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using an Emacs &amp;ldquo;rice&amp;rdquo; named &lt;code&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/code&gt;. Which is effectively a glorified interface for package management that handles all of the initial setup of the packages that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to learn the intricacies of Emacs configuration, how to correctly use Org mode for documentation and organisation and create an Emacs build that only has what I need and want in it. My hope is that by doing so I will learn more of the intricacies of Emacs and will be able to use it more effectively and maybe start writing my own Elisp extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-know&#34;&gt;In The Know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that my experience of learning Emacs from scratch will be interesting enough to some people that I may blog about it a bit. I am not sure whether I will do so by updating this post or by making new posts regarding a specific topic, etc I want to talk about. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modern Books Suck</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/modern-books-suck/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:30:15 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/modern-books-suck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commodification of books and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. There is no legitimate reason for the continued printing of the modern paperback to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-abundance-of-nothing&#34;&gt;An Abundance of Nothing.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s state the obvious first. You walk into your local (or high street) book shop and what do you see promoted the most? Erotic fiction, books about why you should hate yourself, books promoting diets that will kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason for these to exist. They functionally have no contents, they do not contribute to any thing meaningful and serve only as a means to assist consumers in parting with their wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally these books are always printed in a low quality, disposable paperback format. Of course they are not deserving of a higher quality printing anyway, after all the contents of these books is nothing more than a mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books that have stood the test of time will of course have shelf space reserved for them in these shops and the quality difference between them and what surrounds them is night and day. But these books are hardly ever put on the display tables or promoted for sale. In fact most book shops seem to be content to not have these books in stock at all if they can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-paperback-paradox&#34;&gt;The Paperback Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I enter a book shop there is always a &amp;ldquo;new from best sellers&amp;rdquo; as well as a &amp;ldquo;reprinted classics&amp;rdquo; display. The interesting thing is that these best selling authors apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t earn the right to a first edition hardback, something that used to be a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally these so called &amp;ldquo;reprinted classics&amp;rdquo; are always &amp;ldquo;edited for modern sensibilities&amp;rdquo; which of course is just a fancy way of saying censored and modified, making them anything but a reprint and completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather ironic that the perception of the paperback bringing literature to the masses has resulted in the worst quality of writing in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally it is also ironic that the proliferation of paperbacks is for some reason a sacred cow to the very same groups of reactionary liberals that think banning plastic straws will stop the third world from dumping all their trash into the oceans and rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;print-on-demand-and-self-publishing&#34;&gt;Print on Demand and Self-Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting phenomena that has emerged in the last decade has been the ability for authors to self-publish their books using print on demand services like Lulu. This has resulted in some authors that would have been ignored otherwise being able to bring their books to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a double edged sword however as most of these books are of an even worse quality that what is being pushed out by the larger publishing houses. Now if these books really are &amp;ldquo;print on demand&amp;rdquo; and I have no reason to believe otherwise based on my experience with them then the environmental issues are at least minimized if not completely mitigated by preventing the waste of excessive quantities of printing materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print on demand has caused problems for legitimate authors in that they are now competing against algorithms for exposure on self-publishing services. Most book descriptions on Amazon for example look like old YouTube video descriptions with hundreds of unrelated words included for the sake of getting the attention of primitive search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;based-and-red-pilled-book-reviews&#34;&gt;Based and Red pilled Book Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a severe lack of high quality discussion regarding high quality books online. At least from what I can see. &amp;ldquo;BookTube&amp;rdquo; is full of people that recommend books on the cover art alone for example. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that some of them actually read the books but they don&amp;rsquo;t give this impression in their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good books are undoubtedly being published, be it with publishers or via print on demand services but they are competing for attention with books written by algorithms, marketed by algorithms and sold by algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to look out for based and red pilled book reviewers, discussion, etc online of course but in the mean time I should put my keyboard where my mouth is and try to contribute to what I want to see. As such I will start publishing essays, reviews, etc on this very subject on this site. I even made a &lt;code&gt;📚 Books&lt;/code&gt; tag for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Dont Care If You Use Linux</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 19:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen my previous post about Free (as in freedom) software and came to the conclusion that I want to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; normies to using Linux. This is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not care if you use Linux or not, I do not care what distro you use either. Whatever works for you, works for you and that&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I recommend that you use a Linux based OS is not that I personally gain from you doing so but that you will gain from it. I have no attachment to what you use or how you use it. Linux fanboyism is a ridiculous concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;further-confusion&#34;&gt;Further Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &amp;ldquo;What Does The Steam Deck mean?&amp;rdquo; post, someone read it and completely misunderstood it. They were under the impression that I wish to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; gamers to Linux. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had intended to delete that post for being crap anyway, which I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I was trying to make could be made in a sentence but I tried to give too much context. So I will make my point here and consider the issue resolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steam Deck will put more eyes on Linux as a gaming platform. It will not convert the masses to a new operating system that they have no apparent need for. This will not benefit me, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way let&amp;rsquo;s get to the main point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-dont-care-bro&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Care Bro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put if you don&amp;rsquo;t use Linux I don&amp;rsquo;t care and more importantly, if you do use Linux I don&amp;rsquo;t care either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely no need to know or care for what operating system you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-consumer-issue&#34;&gt;The Consumer Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of Linux consumerism has reached its twilight, we now live in a world where people wear Tux t-shirts unironically and discuss their desktop environment of choice as if it is their favourite sportsball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a Linux consumer? A Linux™️ consumer is someone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Linux because they want a Unix like free software operating system, they are just anti-Windows and use Linux as if it were Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I estimate that about 60-70% of people with a Linux based OS on their personal computer would fall under the category of a Linux consumer and as I stated above. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical example is someone that installs whatever meme distro they were shilled then goes on to use Google and Microsoft services, integrating them into every level of their workflow and consumption cycles. It really is an impressive example of cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consuming Linux is a mindset that I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or patience to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put if you need to attach part of your identity to the operating system that you use, you need to get a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;converting-normies&#34;&gt;Converting Normies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only benefit a normie will get from switching to Linux is that their 5 year old laptop won&amp;rsquo;t run to a halt and can still get security patches. The real normie operating system is Google Chrome after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t care about software, ethics, etc. They use their computer to write their homework, read their emails, watch cat videos and buy junk from Amazon. They are content and happy if they can do this, you won&amp;rsquo;t convince them to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youre-just-an-elitist&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re just an elitist!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/yeschad.webp&#34; style=&#34;height:120px; margin:auto; display:block&#34;&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; &#34;&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free As In Freedom</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Libre, not gratis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the specifics of Free Software in this article, if you would like to know more check the &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;freedom-is-non-negotiable&#34;&gt;Freedom is non-negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;memeright&#34; src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/freedom.webp&#34; alt=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34; title=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your freedom as a user is the most important aspect of the software that you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common phrase found online regarding services such as search engines and email service providers goes something like &amp;ldquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you are the product&amp;rdquo;. This is a fairly good summary as it implies (accurately) that these service providers see &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; as an extension of their property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with this statement is the implication that software that is paid for will respect your rights. This is of course not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is straightforward. Don&amp;rsquo;t use them. I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting a boycott (boycotts don&amp;rsquo;t work lol) I am actually just suggesting that you opt out and choose to use Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-change&#34;&gt;Make a change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant services you can change are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office Suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also drop social media and streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem daunting to have to switch all of your service providers but you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it all at once. In fact if you do it slowly over time that is perfectly fine. You may find that you have to do so anyway if you keep on top of sanitising your email inbox, have ongoing projects or need access to a given social media platform to stay in contact with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case you may wish to get them onboard with switching to Free Software and Libre services too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every proprietary service you currently use likely has a Free Software equivalent. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then you probably never needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;regarding-video-games-and-drm&#34;&gt;Regarding Video Games and DRM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video games are almost always proprietary. If you want to play them there are ways to do so on Linux including native Linux binaries. However for those that don&amp;rsquo;t have native binaries you may experience issues with their &amp;ldquo;Anti-Cheat&amp;rdquo; or DRM. I recommend just not buying games that have intrusive layers like that in the first place, it is unacceptable for these companies to treat customers this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. Buy an SD card instead, store your music on that and stick it in your phone. Streaming services take your money and give you nothing in return, you do not own what you &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; they are ripping you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-be-fooled&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source and Free Software are not the same thing and whilst many Open Source programs would fit the definition of Free Software in practice this is not true of all Open Source programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the popular editing suite Visual Studio Code is not free software due to its inclusion of anti-features such as telemetry and centralisation of integrated services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is Telegram, the client software uses a modified GPL3 that makes it non-free and the server software is completely proprietary. Telegram is fundamentally no different from using WhatsApp in terms of user freedoms and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that Android devices are &amp;ldquo;Free&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; but this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. Out of the box these devices do not run Free Software or Open Source software. They run proprietary builds of a semi-open source project but the closed source proprietary nature of the out of the box device makes it a non-free device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these devices can be modified with Free and Open Source Android forks such as LineageOS and GrapheneOS. With GrapheneOS being the superior choice if you own a Google Pixel device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-happy-to-help&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>RSS is Based!</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/rss-is-based/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 08:20:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/rss-is-based/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using Newsboat for RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a proper RSS setup has been on my &amp;ldquo;cosy setup&amp;rdquo; checklist for a while. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much time at all to get it working either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously just used browser plug-ins for this however this approach is terrible in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a proper setup using Newsboat I can truly appreciate RSS feeds and I would recommend using them to anyone that wants to keep up to date with things without engaging with social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-rss&#34;&gt;What is RSS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is an abbreviation of Really Simple Syndication, although this isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rsquo;s original name. Put simply it is a way for you to download a feed from a website and keep up to date with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that instead of using intrusive and manipulated social media feeds to keep up to date with your favourite web feeds you can have it all in one place on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may in fact already be using RSS without realising it. Did you know that most podcast apps are just RSS readers with a media player?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using RSS you can completely replace the need for a Google account to keep up to date with your favourite YouTube channels. Although adding YouTube channels to an RSS feed isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as blogs or podcasts it is doable and once you have done it once the process is quickly repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small caveat to this is that YouTube can choose to eliminate RSS feeds at any time so it may be worth keeping a separate list of channels you subscribe to for the inevitable third party solution that pops up (or perhaps already exists? 👀 Let me know please) if this situation were to arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-rss&#34;&gt;Why use RSS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censorship Resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; You get what you subscribed to, no manipulation by algorithms or loss of access based on social media account status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; Every feed you care for in one place, in whatever order you want, categorised, tagged, etc however you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist:&lt;/strong&gt; No need for accounts or web services. Just a list, add or remove as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable:&lt;/strong&gt; You can read the feeds using any client you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; RSS just loads an XML file from a web server, there is no tracking, JavaScript, middleman services, etc. You get the feed sent directly to you without the need to identify yourself (beyond IP requirements).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-get-started&#34;&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get started by downloading an RSS client. I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;newsboat&lt;/code&gt; - CLI client, highly configurable and easy to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;liferea&lt;/code&gt; - GUI client, highly configurable graphical client, uses GTK+ theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be found in your distro&amp;rsquo;s package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have a client you can start adding your favourite feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add feeds as you go, doing it all at once can be an exhaustive exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a site doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively support RSS you will likely find a tool that can create a feed for you instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sites provide feeds for specific topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the documentation for your chosen client if you need help configuring it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Switching to Markdown Format</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to get comfortable with &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; as a static site generator, I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t made my theme the &amp;ldquo;correct way&amp;rdquo; but for now it works to an acceptable minimum and most importantly the pages it produces are formatted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an issue in that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide if I wanted to use Markdown or HTML when writing blog posts. The issue may seem silly (it is) but my reasons for having it were pretty straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just Works&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to read and write (important for blogging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s intended language (kinda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives me total control via element ids and tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Markdown page elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for very specific inputs into the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate and very flexible control of media inputs (important)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; (currently) supports the use of both at the same time but with some minor issues. Ideally I would prefer to use one standard for blog posts and stick with it. For the sake of uniformity and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I was previously doing when drafting a post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it in Markdown for ease of writing and proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start &lt;code&gt;hugo server -D&lt;/code&gt; so that I can preview the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert everything to HTML in the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check preview again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s all good then publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the issue here should be obvious, I was effectively putting in twice the work for the same result. But this did mean that I had absolute control of the page contents and could ensure certain elements are displayed correctly if I wanted them to have a unique style or position that Markdown itself wouldn&amp;rsquo;t produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realised after the &lt;a href=&#34;learning-german&#34;&gt;Learning German&lt;/a&gt; entry that I could just take the HTML output from the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; output. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to eliminate steps 3 and 4 above. The easiest way to do this is to just eliminate HTML conversion of the entire document and use &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; when needed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates steps 3 and 4 as well as allowing me to control elements very specifically when needed and keeps the document readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So going forward all posts will be created this way unless it isn&amp;rsquo;t viable for the post type. All previous posts will be converted too. Top level pages AKA &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; pages will still be written in HTML for functional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the site will now be rendered using the &lt;code&gt;uglyURLs = true&lt;/code&gt; option as I don&amp;rsquo;t like the look of &lt;code&gt;/blog/post-name/index.html&lt;/code&gt; in the file tree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video Games Are Over</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/video-games-are-over/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/video-games-are-over/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern video games are an industrialised product that satisfies checklists at the cost of a unique identity and product. They are deceptively marketed and maliciously monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally a video game will come out that is just trying to be a fun video game. These are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a nostalgia post, modern video games are genuinely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-they-suck&#34;&gt;Why do they suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer and the correct one is: money. Video games have been watered down and industrialised into a checklist of what sells and what gets social media reactions. Many businesses have been led to believe that social media exposure is free advertising. Anyone with a basic understanding of social media algorithms can tell you why this isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the rise of games as a service has effectively made every video game the same with some aesthetic differences. On top of that these service games are psychologically engineered to encourage you to spend as much time as possible playing their game over the competitor&amp;rsquo;s game as well as spending as much money as possible in their in-game store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; title has become increasingly meaningless as industrial gaming corporations have co-opted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is clearly a desire for video games that are made &amp;ldquo;the old way&amp;rdquo;, games made this way are few and far between and as soon as a developer gets a reputation for making games like this they get acquired by a larger corporation and these types of video game disappear with that acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised video games are produced with the budget of hollywood movies, with checklists (the developers cannot diverge from) of what marketing execs think will sell the product and they would rather divert resources to fighting criticism than taking it on board. All of this results in video games being designed for an &amp;ldquo;average gamer&amp;rdquo; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally and most obviously, video games are no longer being developed by the same type of people. Designers, writes, artists, etc all have agenda&amp;rsquo;s and they intend to use their product to groom you to that agenda. You already knew this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;muh-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Muh nostalgia!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older games were designed differently, no one can dispute this. The way that they were designed respected the player&amp;rsquo;s intelligence and their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the technology to rinse your customers didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet (at least at scale) so even if the idea did cross someone&amp;rsquo;s mind it wasn&amp;rsquo;t implementable in a meaningful or functional way. This led to video games being designed to be challenging, fun and replayable since they wanted you to come back and buy the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers devised their own ways of competing with one another (the origin of speedruns) but most importantly gamers owned their games, they could loan them to friends, they could sell what they didn&amp;rsquo;t like, they could rent to try, some developers even made demos so you didn&amp;rsquo;t need to rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that every old game was great, of course not. A lot of them probably sucked. In fact, most of them did. But the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t suck are still talked about decades later, they are still played decades later, there are entire communities online dedicated to them that have been around almost as long as the games themselves. You won&amp;rsquo;t see this kind of community building effort for most modern games as they are replaced annually and are designed to be played by people that don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply there are three solutions to the problem of modern games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a better hobby. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t go back and play your video games occasionally but being realistic any &amp;ldquo;hobby&amp;rdquo; that isn&amp;rsquo;t productive isn&amp;rsquo;t healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sit back, relax, enjoy your older video games and wait for this accursed industry to collapse in on itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only support developers that respect you as a customer, you can also download an emulator or get some classics from GOG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is that you recognise that modern games are not designed to be fun, but to be addictive and profitable at your expense.&lt;/p&gt;
