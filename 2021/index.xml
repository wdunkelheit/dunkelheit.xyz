      <title>Bitcoin and Monero Extremism</title>

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;postmeme&#34; style=&#34;max-height: 240px;&#34; src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/bitcoin-monero-extremism/monero-pilled.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34; title=&#34;Monero Pilled&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Bitcoin maximalist but I am also a Monero extremist. These positions aren&amp;rsquo;t mutually exclusive. In fact these two technologies combined solve the problems of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;digital-cash-digital-gold&#34;&gt;Digital Cash, Digital Gold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems almost inevitable at this point that Bitcoin will overtake Gold as the strongest (in terms of market cap) store of wealth. Bitcoin is the new gold standard üòâ for storing wealth but it&amp;rsquo;s not very good at being money any more (just like gold). Due to high transaction fees and currency speculation it is better to not use your Bitcoin and to just HODL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are emergent technologies trying to solve this problem like the lightning network there are some issues regarding anonymity and privacy that makes traditional cash superior for transacting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Monero comes in. Being the only cryptocurrency that allows for transactions to be both anonymous and private, Monero functions almost exactly like physical cash does, except digitally and without out of control money printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero can be swapped for Bitcoin using decentralised platforms too meaning you do not require the traditional finance system to acquire it. There is also the experimental technology of atomic swaps that allows private chain-to-chain transactions to swap one crypto for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons Bitcoin and Monero are the only cryptocurrencies that have legitimate use cases as currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;utility-tokens&#34;&gt;Utility Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other cryptocurrencies that aren&amp;rsquo;t shitcoins but these are mostly utility tokens such as the Brave foundation&amp;rsquo;s BAT (Basic Attention Token) and Namecoin. But as utility tokens these function as a means to an end and not as a form of savings or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;proof-of-stake---proof-of-shitcoin&#34;&gt;Proof of stake - Proof of shitcoin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof of stake is anti-crypto. It allows for the largest bag holders to control the network and takes the decentralisation of proof of work away. Making transactions censorable and the currency defacto non-fungible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;muh-power-usage&#34;&gt;Muh power usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most energy alarmism this is a non-issue. If you understand how electric power is generated and how much of it goes to waste due to fluctuations in demand then you will see that Bitcoin actually incentivises energy innovation and prevents waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact this is demonstrated in real life Bitcoin mining practices. Countries with cheap electricity get more Bitcoin mining operations in them which brings more money into the local economy as well as incentivising said means of creating energy. El Salvador plans to mine Bitcoin using geothermal for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great way to explain how Bitcoin mining reduces waste is that miners seeking the highest return on their investment will go where the energy is cheapest and most abundant, leaving the places were it is more costly and limited. This effectively allows for excess energy production in one part of the world to be utilised elsewhere by proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-friends-into-crypto&#34;&gt;Getting friends into crypto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting friends and family into crypto can be difficult. A cool trick I found is to get them to install a wallet app, send them a small amount (about $5 worth) and show them how easy it is to use by sending it back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better to show and not tell, especially when trying to explain bleeding edge technologies. However you will want to make sure that person you are introducing cryptocurrencies to understands the importance of self custody, securing their devices, backing up their seed phrases, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will be technically competent enough to do all of this which is fine. If this is the case then you will need to adjust as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is easiest to get people into as it has brand recognition and is the easiest to acquire. It also has a reputation of being &amp;ldquo;internet stocks&amp;rdquo; which attracts the wrong kind of attitude sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monero is harder to recommend to people as most people that get into crypto just want gains and don&amp;rsquo;t see the point in using it as money when they can use money. I understand this position and why it is held, which is why I generally only recommend Monero to people that are already internet present. That is not to say however that I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to people anyway, just that if they have no real use for it then they will be better off just buying some Bitcoin sats instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact one thing that Monero is excellent for is teaching someone the basics of how cryptocurrencies work with real life examples but without breaking the bank. It is also good at giving people an idea of how other cryptocurrencies aren&amp;rsquo;t private or anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Generating QR Codes for Crypto</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/generating-qr-codes-for-crypto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a blog or a website or have any kind of online presence then you should be accepting crypto donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not explain why you should accept crypto here because &lt;a href=&#34;https://landchad.net/crypto&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; exists. Please read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crypto-addresses&#34;&gt;Crypto Addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to use third party platforms to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need is your address and you are good to go. In this example I will be assuming that you have custody of your crypto wallet(s) and don&amp;rsquo;t use fiat-crypto‚Ñ¢Ô∏è platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example I will be using a Monero address but the same method will work for all cryptocurrencies that use a single-string address. Which &lt;a href=&#34;#tips&#34;&gt;all two&lt;/a&gt; of the important ones do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all you are going to want to know your Crypto receive address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this for Monero: &lt;code&gt;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly you are going to want to install the &lt;code&gt;python-qrcode&lt;/code&gt; package. It is available under this name on Arch and Debian based distros. It can also be &lt;a href=&#34;https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/&#34;&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have these two tools you are ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generating-the-qr-code&#34;&gt;Generating the QR code.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the following into your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your crypto address&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with your actual address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;qr &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;87ukrCxsbK79rQbGwutzTmE4RDPiayn3xK5JT63iiSks5Q9TMCsXzUibXEea1q6x6ij6u2UDxzXpNBU5bP4u8Wz34esoLRG&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; xmr.png
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will now have a png image file in your current directory. You can now use this on your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of it in use see &lt;a href=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/donate&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-use-this-program&#34;&gt;Why Use This Program?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be considering using an online QR code generator. But any code running on someone else&amp;rsquo;s hardware cannot be trusted with something as sensitive as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an advanced user you can use this tool with optimisation options or you can output your QR code to an SVG instead. You can use this in combination with other QR code optimisation tools to minimize the file size if that is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two cryptocurrencies actually matter these are Bitcoin and Monero. All other cryptos are gambling or memes (or a dangerous combination of both). &lt;strong&gt;Not financial advice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always give the user the option to donate with the address itself too. In fact its a good idea to provide the address with the QR code so that they can verify the QR resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be a good idea to create a minimalist solution to allow the user to expand the page with the given QR codes if you plan to include them on other pages on your site. This is only relevant if your site doesn&amp;rsquo;t accommodate for this in its design anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Bloating Your Shell</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/stop-bloating-your-shell/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 09:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/stop-bloating-your-shell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably my favourite part of using Linux is that I can customise my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customisation options for some of the fundamental tools I use are endless and they are customisable by design. I have probably spent more time customising, modifying and tweaking my shell configurations than any other piece of software on my system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this article I will be using &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; as the example shell unless stated otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-shell-is-a-tool-not-a-toy&#34;&gt;A shell is a tool, not a toy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put the shell is a tool. Whether you are using it interactively or you are scripting tasks, you must use your shell correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the shell is a tool you should be more concerned with what it is for than how it looks. You should also be aware of the dangers of using it incorrectly and the dangers of misunderstanding it while using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shells support a form of regex which allows you to be as explicit or implicit as you need when creating a command to be run. The use of the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; on its own in shell scripts should be avoided for this reason. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to accidentally delete your entire home folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-dont-need-plugin-managers&#34;&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Need Plugin Managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of plugin managers for a shell is peak soydev and a completely ridiculous concept, so why do so many people fall for it? The answer is simple, they are soydevs and do not understand the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular plugin manager seems to be &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; shell. It is nothing more than an obfuscated fronted for features that are built into &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt;. You do not need it to install anything. You can &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; these plugins manually in your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these managers makes your shell take longer to load, adds unneeded complexity and causes problems if you want to do something outside of its scope. Not only that but it turns your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file into a complete and utter mess for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop using them, you don&amp;rsquo;t need them. It&amp;rsquo;s lazy and encourages bad practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-your-own-plugins&#34;&gt;Make your own plugins!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a ridiculous number of aliases? Would you prefer not to scroll through them? You can make these into their own plugin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above with how to load a plugin you simply need to source the plugin file. Plugin files for &lt;code&gt;zsh&lt;/code&gt; are actually just &lt;code&gt;.zsh&lt;/code&gt; files and you can make your own. All you need to do is place your aliases in a new file, place the file somewhere appropriate, ensure that the file&amp;rsquo;s shebang is correct: &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/zsh&lt;/code&gt; and then source that file in the .zshrc file like so:
&lt;code&gt;source /path/to/new/alias/plugin.zsh 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t do this with my aliases and would recommend not doing so but this is a good example of how plugins work, they are just &lt;code&gt;.zsh&lt;/code&gt; scripts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aliasing-correctly&#34;&gt;Aliasing correctly.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliases are probably my favourite part of using the shell for most of my needs. You can ensure that a command such as &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; always uses colours, you can create adjacently named commands such as &lt;code&gt;ll&lt;/code&gt; for example to run &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally you can bind scripts and long and complicated single line commands to a single word for ease of use. For example I use &lt;code&gt;dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; for managing my dotfiles git repository, I have some scripts that I also like to invoke for things such as checking for updates from all programs on my system, checking crypto prices, etc that I can do with a single word instead of writing the full file path. Although I do I keep these scripts in my &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; I use a naming convention that makes it easier to tell what script it is but it is easier to just invoke them with an alias instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing you should not do with aliases however is use them to replace a program. It is bad practice to &amp;ldquo;rename&amp;rdquo; a core program such as &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; with an alternative you found online. You should instead be using this tool by its name so that you are aware of what you are doing. Using aliases to obfuscate what you are doing is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shebang&#34;&gt;Shebang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shebang (shell bang) is used to ensure that the correct shell language is used when a file is run. For example &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; would be used if a script is POSIX compliant only and uses no Non-POSIX commands. For example if you write a script in &lt;code&gt;BASH&lt;/code&gt; and it uses bashisms, then your shebang should be &lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the shebang in your scripts correctly means that when you invoke them from another shell the correct shell program is used to interpret the script. There are tools for testing your shell scripts so that you know what shebang to use, what adjustments to make to use, etc. I personally quite like &lt;code&gt;shellcheck&lt;/code&gt; but there are other options out there. However you should not rely on these tools and should be familiar with the commands you are using and how they work before committing them to a script. You can always check their man pages or other documentation before you commit to their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally all scripts should be POSIX compliant only, bashisms are very tempting to use as they do give you more options for your script but there is a good chance you just do not need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remote-shells&#34;&gt;Remote Shells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you connect to other devices using a tool like &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; then you should ensure that the remote user&amp;rsquo;s shell config is configured correctly for this. A few examples of what not to do are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invocation of programs with &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard declaring terminal (and emulator) compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting background processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;additional-recommendations&#34;&gt;Additional recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When declaring your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable you should do so explicitly, it may seem fun to use a script to do this but that is additional startup logic that you do not need and a script that you now need to maintain. Additionally you should not be declaring the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file it should be declared in your &lt;code&gt;.zprofile&lt;/code&gt; file so that your application launcher (assuming dmenu) is &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of using a script that iterates through all the sub-directories of your &lt;code&gt;.local/bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory just declare them like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sh&#34; data-lang=&#34;sh&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/go&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;export PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;$PATH&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;$HOME&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;/.local/bin/sh&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This example is from my &lt;code&gt;.zshrc&lt;/code&gt; file, which you can find here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/wdunkelheit/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/zsh/.zshrc&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-process&#34;&gt;Learning process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, using the shell is a learning process. The more you use it and tinker with it they more you will learn.

      <title>The Emacs Rabbit Hole</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/the-emacs-rabbit-hole/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/the-emacs-rabbit-hole/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Emacs as my text editor for about a year now. I still have no idea what I am doing but at least I know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cosy-and-powerful&#34;&gt;Cosy and Powerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emacs client is very lightweight and it can be self-extended whilst running by using Elisp. I am not quite sure how it works as Elisp is too far down the rabbit hole and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is very modular to the point that you can use it as an entire operating system if you so choose. It can be used as a windowing manager, a web browser, an email client. Not bad for a text editor right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believe that this makes Emacs monolithic but that is due to a misconception that Emacs itself is doing all of these things and not the independent Elisp and C programs running within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago I learned that you can run Emacs as a server, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what purpose this would have but it sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vim-gang&#34;&gt;Vim gang&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to using Emacs I used Vim as my editor of choice. I still do for single file editing. I love the Vim keybindings, macros, instruction language, etc. So when I heard that you can use these in Emacs with Evil mode I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-year-later&#34;&gt;One Year Later&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I have found to be the most impressive about Emacs after a year of use is how it just &amp;ldquo;works&amp;rdquo; in a minimalist way. There&amp;rsquo;s no bells and whistles, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to use my mouse for anything. Once it has been launched it is ready to go, my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Evil mode in Emacs and it is indistinguishable from using Vim in a terminal except I am no longer held back by any limitations built into a given terminal emulator. At first I missed being unable to use Alt key for quick normal mode instructions but I have since rebound my keyboard to be more Emacs compatible and find the Emacs way of doing things more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to try Emacs tools such as &lt;code&gt;magit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rmail&lt;/code&gt; but this is mostly due to wanting to wait until I learn Emacs properly. Speaking of which&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-off-the-training-wheels&#34;&gt;Taking off the training wheels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to learn Emacs from scratch, as it stands for the last year I have not been using Emacs &amp;ldquo;correctly&amp;rdquo; in the sense that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been using it in a way that allows me to learn how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using an Emacs &amp;ldquo;rice&amp;rdquo; named &lt;code&gt;Doom Emacs&lt;/code&gt;. Which is effectively a glorified interface for package management that handles all of the initial setup of the packages that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to learn the intricacies of Emacs configuration, how to correctly use Org mode for documentation and organisation and create an Emacs build that only has what I need and want in it. My hope is that by doing so I will learn more of the intricacies of Emacs and will be able to use it more effectively and maybe start writing my own Elisp extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-know&#34;&gt;In The Know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that my experience of learning Emacs from scratch will be interesting enough to some people that I may blog about it a bit. I am not sure whether I will do so by updating this post or by making new posts regarding a specific topic, etc I want to talk about. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modern Books Suck</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/modern-books-suck/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:30:15 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/modern-books-suck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The commodification of books and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. There is no legitimate reason for the continued printing of the modern paperback to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;an-abundance-of-nothing&#34;&gt;An Abundance of Nothing.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s state the obvious first. You walk into your local (or high street) book shop and what do you see promoted the most? Erotic fiction, books about why you should hate yourself, books promoting diets that will kill you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason for these to exist. They functionally have no contents, they do not contribute to any thing meaningful and serve only as a means to assist consumers in parting with their wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally these books are always printed in a low quality, disposable paperback format. Of course they are not deserving of a higher quality printing anyway, after all the contents of these books is nothing more than a mockery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books that have stood the test of time will of course have shelf space reserved for them in these shops and the quality difference between them and what surrounds them is night and day. But these books are hardly ever put on the display tables or promoted for sale. In fact most book shops seem to be content to not have these books in stock at all if they can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-paperback-paradox&#34;&gt;The Paperback Paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I enter a book shop there is always a &amp;ldquo;new from best sellers&amp;rdquo; as well as a &amp;ldquo;reprinted classics&amp;rdquo; display. The interesting thing is that these best selling authors apparently didn&amp;rsquo;t earn the right to a first edition hardback, something that used to be a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally these so called &amp;ldquo;reprinted classics&amp;rdquo; are always &amp;ldquo;edited for modern sensibilities&amp;rdquo; which of course is just a fancy way of saying censored and modified, making them anything but a reprint and completely useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rather ironic that the perception of the paperback bringing literature to the masses has resulted in the worst quality of writing in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally it is also ironic that the proliferation of paperbacks is for some reason a sacred cow to the very same groups of reactionary liberals that think banning plastic straws will stop the third world from dumping all their trash into the oceans and rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;print-on-demand-and-self-publishing&#34;&gt;Print on Demand and Self-Publishing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting phenomena that has emerged in the last decade has been the ability for authors to self-publish their books using print on demand services like Lulu. This has resulted in some authors that would have been ignored otherwise being able to bring their books to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a double edged sword however as most of these books are of an even worse quality that what is being pushed out by the larger publishing houses. Now if these books really are &amp;ldquo;print on demand&amp;rdquo; and I have no reason to believe otherwise based on my experience with them then the environmental issues are at least minimized if not completely mitigated by preventing the waste of excessive quantities of printing materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print on demand has caused problems for legitimate authors in that they are now competing against algorithms for exposure on self-publishing services. Most book descriptions on Amazon for example look like old YouTube video descriptions with hundreds of unrelated words included for the sake of getting the attention of primitive search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;based-and-red-pilled-book-reviews&#34;&gt;Based and Red pilled Book Reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a severe lack of high quality discussion regarding high quality books online. At least from what I can see. &amp;ldquo;BookTube&amp;rdquo; is full of people that recommend books on the cover art alone for example. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that some of them actually read the books but they don&amp;rsquo;t give this impression in their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good books are undoubtedly being published, be it with publishers or via print on demand services but they are competing for attention with books written by algorithms, marketed by algorithms and sold by algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to look out for based and red pilled book reviewers, discussion, etc online of course but in the mean time I should put my keyboard where my mouth is and try to contribute to what I want to see. As such I will start publishing essays, reviews, etc on this very subject on this site. I even made a &lt;code&gt;üìö Books&lt;/code&gt; tag for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Dont Care If You Use Linux</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 19:30:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen my previous post about Free (as in freedom) software and came to the conclusion that I want to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; normies to using Linux. This is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not care if you use Linux or not, I do not care what distro you use either. Whatever works for you, works for you and that&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I recommend that you use a Linux based OS is not that I personally gain from you doing so but that you will gain from it. I have no attachment to what you use or how you use it. Linux fanboyism is a ridiculous concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;further-confusion&#34;&gt;Further Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &amp;ldquo;What Does The Steam Deck mean?&amp;rdquo; post, someone read it and completely misunderstood it. They were under the impression that I wish to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; gamers to Linux. LOL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had intended to delete that post for being crap anyway, which I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I was trying to make could be made in a sentence but I tried to give too much context. So I will make my point here and consider the issue resolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steam Deck will put more eyes on Linux as a gaming platform. It will not convert the masses to a new operating system that they have no apparent need for. This will not benefit me, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way let&amp;rsquo;s get to the main point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-dont-care-bro&#34;&gt;I Don&amp;rsquo;t Care Bro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put if you don&amp;rsquo;t use Linux I don&amp;rsquo;t care and more importantly, if you do use Linux I don&amp;rsquo;t care either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely no need to know or care for what operating system you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-consumer-issue&#34;&gt;The Consumer Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of Linux consumerism has reached its twilight, we now live in a world where people wear Tux t-shirts unironically and discuss their desktop environment of choice as if it is their favourite sportsball team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a Linux consumer? A Linux‚Ñ¢Ô∏è consumer is someone that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Linux because they want a Unix like free software operating system, they are just anti-Windows and use Linux as if it were Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I estimate that about 60-70% of people with a Linux based OS on their personal computer would fall under the category of a Linux consumer and as I stated above. I don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical example is someone that installs whatever meme distro they were shilled then goes on to use Google and Microsoft services, integrating them into every level of their workflow and consumption cycles. It really is an impressive example of cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consuming Linux is a mindset that I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or patience to entertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put if you need to attach part of your identity to the operating system that you use, you need to get a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;converting-normies&#34;&gt;Converting Normies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only benefit a normie will get from switching to Linux is that their 5 year old laptop won&amp;rsquo;t run to a halt and can still get security patches. The real normie operating system is Google Chrome after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t care about software, ethics, etc. They use their computer to write their homework, read their emails, watch cat videos and buy junk from Amazon. They are content and happy if they can do this, you won&amp;rsquo;t convince them to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youre-just-an-elitist&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re just an elitist!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/i-dont-care-if-you-use-linux/yeschad.webp&#34; style=&#34;height:120px; margin:auto; display:block&#34;&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center; &#34;&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free As In Freedom</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Libre, not gratis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the specifics of Free Software in this article, if you would like to know more check the &lt;a href=&#34;#references&#34;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;freedom-is-non-negotiable&#34;&gt;Freedom is non-negotiable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;memeright&#34; src=&#34;https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/free-as-in-freedom/freedom.webp&#34; alt=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34; title=&#34;GNU Pepe&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your freedom as a user is the most important aspect of the software that you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common phrase found online regarding services such as search engines and email service providers goes something like &amp;ldquo;if it&amp;rsquo;s free then you are the product&amp;rdquo;. This is a fairly good summary as it implies (accurately) that these service providers see &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; as an extension of their property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with this statement is the implication that software that is paid for will respect your rights. This is of course not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem is straightforward. Don&amp;rsquo;t use them. I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting a boycott (boycotts don&amp;rsquo;t work lol) I am actually just suggesting that you opt out and choose to use Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-change&#34;&gt;Make a change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant services you can change are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email Provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office Suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also drop social media and streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem daunting to have to switch all of your service providers but you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do it all at once. In fact if you do it slowly over time that is perfectly fine. You may find that you have to do so anyway if you keep on top of sanitising your email inbox, have ongoing projects or need access to a given social media platform to stay in contact with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latter case you may wish to get them onboard with switching to Free Software and Libre services too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every proprietary service you currently use likely has a Free Software equivalent. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then you probably never needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;regarding-video-games-and-drm&#34;&gt;Regarding Video Games and DRM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video games are almost always proprietary. If you want to play them there are ways to do so on Linux including native Linux binaries. However for those that don&amp;rsquo;t have native binaries you may experience issues with their &amp;ldquo;Anti-Cheat&amp;rdquo; or DRM. I recommend just not buying games that have intrusive layers like that in the first place, it is unacceptable for these companies to treat customers this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay away from streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. Buy an SD card instead, store your music on that and stick it in your phone. Streaming services take your money and give you nothing in return, you do not own what you &amp;ldquo;stream&amp;rdquo; they are ripping you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-be-fooled&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source and Free Software are not the same thing and whilst many Open Source programs would fit the definition of Free Software in practice this is not true of all Open Source programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the popular editing suite Visual Studio Code is not free software due to its inclusion of anti-features such as telemetry and centralisation of integrated services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is Telegram, the client software uses a modified GPL3 that makes it non-free and the server software is completely proprietary. Telegram is fundamentally no different from using WhatsApp in terms of user freedoms and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common misconception is that Android devices are &amp;ldquo;Free&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; but this couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. Out of the box these devices do not run Free Software or Open Source software. They run proprietary builds of a semi-open source project but the closed source proprietary nature of the out of the box device makes it a non-free device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these devices can be modified with Free and Open Source Android forks such as LineageOS and GrapheneOS. With GrapheneOS being the superior choice if you own a Google Pixel device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;im-happy-to-help&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m happy to help&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>RSS is Based!</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/rss-is-based/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 08:20:25 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/rss-is-based/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using Newsboat for RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a proper RSS setup has been on my &amp;ldquo;cosy setup&amp;rdquo; checklist for a while. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take much time at all to get it working either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously just used browser plug-ins for this however this approach is terrible in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a proper setup using Newsboat I can truly appreciate RSS feeds and I would recommend using them to anyone that wants to keep up to date with things without engaging with social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-rss&#34;&gt;What is RSS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is an abbreviation of Really Simple Syndication, although this isn&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rsquo;s original name. Put simply it is a way for you to download a feed from a website and keep up to date with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that instead of using intrusive and manipulated social media feeds to keep up to date with your favourite web feeds you can have it all in one place on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may in fact already be using RSS without realising it. Did you know that most podcast apps are just RSS readers with a media player?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using RSS you can completely replace the need for a Google account to keep up to date with your favourite YouTube channels. Although adding YouTube channels to an RSS feed isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as blogs or podcasts it is doable and once you have done it once the process is quickly repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small caveat to this is that YouTube can choose to eliminate RSS feeds at any time so it may be worth keeping a separate list of channels you subscribe to for the inevitable third party solution that pops up (or perhaps already exists? üëÄ Let me know please) if this situation were to arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-use-rss&#34;&gt;Why use RSS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censorship Resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; You get what you subscribed to, no manipulation by algorithms or loss of access based on social media account status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience:&lt;/strong&gt; Every feed you care for in one place, in whatever order you want, categorised, tagged, etc however you see fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalist:&lt;/strong&gt; No need for accounts or web services. Just a list, add or remove as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portable:&lt;/strong&gt; You can read the feeds using any client you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; RSS just loads an XML file from a web server, there is no tracking, JavaScript, middleman services, etc. You get the feed sent directly to you without the need to identify yourself (beyond IP requirements).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-get-started&#34;&gt;How do I get started?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get started by downloading an RSS client. I recommend the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;newsboat&lt;/code&gt; - CLI client, highly configurable and easy to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;liferea&lt;/code&gt; - GUI client, highly configurable graphical client, uses GTK+ theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be found in your distro&amp;rsquo;s package manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have a client you can start adding your favourite feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips&#34;&gt;Tips:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add feeds as you go, doing it all at once can be an exhaustive exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a site doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively support RSS you will likely find a tool that can create a feed for you instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sites provide feeds for specific topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the documentation for your chosen client if you need help configuring it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Switching to Markdown Format</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/switching-to-markdown-format/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to get comfortable with &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; as a static site generator, I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t made my theme the &amp;ldquo;correct way&amp;rdquo; but for now it works to an acceptable minimum and most importantly the pages it produces are formatted perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an issue in that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t decide if I wanted to use Markdown or HTML when writing blog posts. The issue may seem silly (it is) but my reasons for having it were pretty straight forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markdown:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just Works&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to read and write (important for blogging)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo&amp;rsquo;s intended language (kinda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HTML:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives me total control via element ids and tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Markdown page elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for very specific inputs into the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accurate and very flexible control of media inputs (important)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; (currently) supports the use of both at the same time but with some minor issues. Ideally I would prefer to use one standard for blog posts and stick with it. For the sake of uniformity and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I was previously doing when drafting a post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write it in Markdown for ease of writing and proofreading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start &lt;code&gt;hugo server -D&lt;/code&gt; so that I can preview the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert everything to HTML in the document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check preview again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s all good then publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the issue here should be obvious, I was effectively putting in twice the work for the same result. But this did mean that I had absolute control of the page contents and could ensure certain elements are displayed correctly if I wanted them to have a unique style or position that Markdown itself wouldn&amp;rsquo;t produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realised after the &lt;a href=&#34;learning-german&#34;&gt;Learning German&lt;/a&gt; entry that I could just take the HTML output from the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; output. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to eliminate steps 3 and 4 above. The easiest way to do this is to just eliminate HTML conversion of the entire document and use &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt; when needed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates steps 3 and 4 as well as allowing me to control elements very specifically when needed and keeps the document readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So going forward all posts will be created this way unless it isn&amp;rsquo;t viable for the post type. All previous posts will be converted too. Top level pages AKA &amp;ldquo;base&amp;rdquo; pages will still be written in HTML for functional reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the site will now be rendered using the &lt;code&gt;uglyURLs = true&lt;/code&gt; option as I don&amp;rsquo;t like the look of &lt;code&gt;/blog/post-name/index.html&lt;/code&gt; in the file tree.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video Games Are Over</title>
      <link>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/video-games-are-over/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dunkelheit.xyz/blog/video-games-are-over/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern video games are an industrialised product that satisfies checklists at the cost of a unique identity and product. They are deceptively marketed and maliciously monetized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally a video game will come out that is just trying to be a fun video game. These are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a nostalgia post, modern video games are genuinely terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-they-suck&#34;&gt;Why do they suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple answer and the correct one is: money. Video games have been watered down and industrialised into a checklist of what sells and what gets social media reactions. Many businesses have been led to believe that social media exposure is free advertising. Anyone with a basic understanding of social media algorithms can tell you why this isn&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the rise of games as a service has effectively made every video game the same with some aesthetic differences. On top of that these service games are psychologically engineered to encourage you to spend as much time as possible playing their game over the competitor&amp;rsquo;s game as well as spending as much money as possible in their in-game store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;indie&amp;rdquo; title has become increasingly meaningless as industrial gaming corporations have co-opted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is clearly a desire for video games that are made &amp;ldquo;the old way&amp;rdquo;, games made this way are few and far between and as soon as a developer gets a reputation for making games like this they get acquired by a larger corporation and these types of video game disappear with that acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrialised video games are produced with the budget of hollywood movies, with checklists (the developers cannot diverge from) of what marketing execs think will sell the product and they would rather divert resources to fighting criticism than taking it on board. All of this results in video games being designed for an &amp;ldquo;average gamer&amp;rdquo; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally and most obviously, video games are no longer being developed by the same type of people. Designers, writes, artists, etc all have agenda&amp;rsquo;s and they intend to use their product to groom you to that agenda. You already knew this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;muh-nostalgia&#34;&gt;Muh nostalgia!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older games were designed differently, no one can dispute this. The way that they were designed respected the player&amp;rsquo;s intelligence and their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally the technology to rinse your customers didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet (at least at scale) so even if the idea did cross someone&amp;rsquo;s mind it wasn&amp;rsquo;t implementable in a meaningful or functional way. This led to video games being designed to be challenging, fun and replayable since they wanted you to come back and buy the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers devised their own ways of competing with one another (the origin of speedruns) but most importantly gamers owned their games, they could loan them to friends, they could sell what they didn&amp;rsquo;t like, they could rent to try, some developers even made demos so you didn&amp;rsquo;t need to rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that every old game was great, of course not. A lot of them probably sucked. In fact, most of them did. But the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t suck are still talked about decades later, they are still played decades later, there are entire communities online dedicated to them that have been around almost as long as the games themselves. You won&amp;rsquo;t see this kind of community building effort for most modern games as they are replaced annually and are designed to be played by people that don&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions&#34;&gt;Solutions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply there are three solutions to the problem of modern games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a better hobby. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t go back and play your video games occasionally but being realistic any &amp;ldquo;hobby&amp;rdquo; that isn&amp;rsquo;t productive isn&amp;rsquo;t healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just sit back, relax, enjoy your older video games and wait for this accursed industry to collapse in on itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only support developers that respect you as a customer, you can also download an emulator or get some classics from GOG.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important part is that you recognise that modern games are not designed to be fun, but to be addictive and profitable at your expense.&lt;/p&gt;
